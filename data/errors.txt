Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   
        
                 
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )    
                          
Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.
            
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.  Modern technology like the internet must be considered.
                 
             
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost.

ERROR:
American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”. I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product, but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality, but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief.

&gt; The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces

Most people aren't paid on commission, so this isn't really a good example, but I think I get where you're going with it. 

&gt;if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce

But the money doesn't just disappear.  For one thing, you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't "produce" anything.  You're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.  

Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced.  This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that's where supply and demand are involved.  

I'm not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it, but that's more a failure of the system than the system itself.  The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won't sell and will be waste, but that's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.

No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.  

If you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient, then no one is going to dispute you, but I will point out that it's the most efficient real system we have.

Anyone *can* run for office. You might not get very far, but you can run. And you don't need millions of dollars, you need to be *able to raise* millions of dollars. In itself, I don't see a problem with that. Raising large amounts of money requires leadership, diplomacy, organization, charisma… all traits I like to see in my elected officials. The corruption and lack of transparency created by PACs and SuperPACs and Citizens United in general is definitely a major problem, but like some other things that have come up in this discussion, it's not an issue that makes the USA an un-democratic state. There's no rule saying that the person who raises the most money wins the election. The fact that most people vote for the most visible candidate on their side rather than the one that most closely represents their interests is a problem with the electorate and also a result of our winner-take-all voting system, but neither of those are in conflict with the USA being a democracy by definition.

You do realize that Navajo is just as offensive, right?  The proper name is Diné.  The Spanish called them Navajo.

Where do you live?  Here in New Mexico (state with the 2nd highest native/Indian percentage of population and more than 1/3 of the total Diné population) Indian is the preferred term.  In reality, none of my native/Indian friends care about the native American vs Indian debate.  They care more about Diné vs Navajo, but are not even close to being offended.  

In their minds, the Indian vs Native American debate is about a group that never existed until after Europeans were here.  There were dozens (hundreds?) of names for the Americas by the different tribes.  Calling the land America is just as legitimate as any other name.  

So to them, calling them native Americans or Indians isn't offensive at all.  It's just a term for a group that wasn't a group (and had almost nothing in common other than the continent they lived on) until outsiders showed up.  They care more about you referring to their actual tribe by the correct name... in my friends' cases Diné.

&gt; It seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate "not believing one's story" with "disbelieving one's story", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite—but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. 

This is my fundamental issue with your argument. While in real life "truth" is not black and white, believing someone is. Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying "I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. 

Imagine a victim of another "emotional" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said "Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape." While that story *could* be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, "I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying "I don't really believe you" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.

I don't disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is "innocent until proven guilty". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by /r/serialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder 15 years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. 

To tip my hand a little, I am a woman in her late 20s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant-- I worked with him-- and my assault was one of those messy instances where, as a victim, I didn't do the *right* thing. I was drinking underage, I trusted someone that others perceived as "shady", I was very friendly and kind to him which "gave him the wrong idea". I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired, everyone in my workplace *blamed* me, started rumors about my sexual activity, and all-around implied (or sometimes, said outright) that I was lying. 

My sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be "put on trial", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. 

I told that story because the social/cultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a *major* part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off, to read a radical feminist's post on tumblr about how "all sex is rape" and internalize the fact that, if women really wanted to, they could avoid most rape-y situations. Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any *less* bad? 

In our public's eyes, it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victim's life on trial, when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire), I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands, and you can't ignore that piece of it in my mind.

It's so commonplace now to offer things "free" in order to sell products and services. For example: get 30 days free when you sign up to a 12 month contract; 50% extra free on a box of detergent, free £5 voucher when you spend £30 or more, etc etc.

If something is truly free, it comes at no cost to the consumer. No strings attached. When you get 50% extra detergent for free, what you're actually doing is paying for the whole box at less per gram than usual. They take the hit on the gross margin in order to sell more.

The word "free" in cases like this is misleading - as a consumer, to get these "free" goods and services, you end up worse off financially, and for that reason I think it should be against the law to use it if a purchase is required. Please change my view!

First, I'll state that I have mostly anecdotes to support my view but it is one I completely believe in. Additionally, I have no idea if it's a popular opinion or not. Here goes…

**I believe that nations within the tropics (Cancer to Capricorn) have disproportionately higher government corruption than those found in the more northernly and southernly regions of the earth.**

edit: to u/slf1452's point, I am referring to contemporary governments (lacking data on all civilizations). 

That includes nations that are only partially within the tropical region (e.g. Mexico). My opinion is based on the region as a whole, so individual exceptions will not alter my perspective (e.g. Australia).

To CMV, you will need to move me on either of the following points:

1. Demonstrate that there is not more corruption, on average, in the tropics vs. the non-tropics. - OR - 
2. Demonstrate that if there is disproportionate corruption, on average, that it is specifically unrelated to the geographical location of the countries.

I just feel like the future looks very sinister for the global society. Governments are spying on us more than ever, they have the ability to manipulate and oppress us on a scale never seen before.
Europe's economy is slowly crumbling and with it many its advancements to society (such as its highly developed social security ). Wealth distribution is at its worst since 1929 ([source](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/11/daily-chart-2?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/somearemoreequalthanothers)) . 
 
Meanwhile china, a country which is known for oppression, censorship, lack of freedom, democracy, etc, is on the rise to become the next global superpower in terms of economics - and possibly influence.

While I do realize this is a going to be a slow process that will take decades, it just seems inevitable that 200 years of social progress is slowly being erased.

That's your takeaway from the videos?   
     
&gt;Thinking it through for a small time I could think of no good reasons why Street Harassment wasn't somehow criminalized, especially with all of the legislation protecting women from harassment in the workplace (Or providing them ample recourse if they are harassed).      
     
People aren't protected from harassment in the work place by law, that is all done inside the company. Sexual harassment and assault are covered under law but also has nothing to do with street harassment (unless physical contact is made).
      
&gt;What could the possible issues be of penalizing Street Harassment? Would it be a good idea to enact legislation against Catcalling (Whether on a local, state or federal basis)?      
     
Talking to people is not prohibited. Restricting that is in violation of freedom of speech. Attacking people, physically handling someone, or hurling abuse at people is already covered under law (assault, rape, etc). Catcalling is none of those things. 
ERROR:
I think that the state of the world should not necessarily influence your decision to have/not have children. The whole "the world is getting worse" idea has been around for all of history. It's just a depressing feature of being an intelligent being (the fact that we have to worry about how our actions affect others).     
    
Why is the world getting worse? Technology is progressing at a much faster rate. There are no World Wars, no conflicts where hundreds of millions of people die. We hear more "sad" things only because we have access to vast amounts of information, more than we have ever had access to before. There are more people, yes, but that seems to not be the reasoning behind you not wanting to have kids (which would be an arguable reason).     
     
The whole "the world is going to shit" is not a great idea to have in your head. Other than the fact it is depressing and doesn't make you have a very good worldview, it is also just not true. People have had that attitude for ages, but the world progresses none the less. That attitude leads to becoming a old-timer who just raves about how much simpler a time it used to be while being completely ignorant of today's society; someone who looks to the past, and not the future. 
ERROR:
More information is a good thing, yes. Being educated about the world is important, and the way that is achieved by having a free flow of information, a lot of it. The spread of information is a lot about how you perceive it as well. You have access to all kinds of information. If you choose to be more affected by information you think is negative, then you will think negatively, and vice versa for positive information.    
     
Advancing technology does not necessarily have to be a good thing, but it is essential. Stagnated societies crumble very quickly (see [the fall of the Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire)) and innovation leads to improvements in how we do anything. Luddites would want us to be back in "the good old days" but we can't go back to the past. We just have to keep the human race going.  
ERROR:
No, I'm sorry, but that's not how it works. Yes, you can be biased towards one thing, but the whole point of a bias is its just an inclination. If you care to change it, you can. You were not "born to be negative". That's like saying you're unhealthy because you have a bias towards not exercising and therefore can't change it. It's just a massive cop-out.    
     
Also, saying all humans are born to accept negative information more is just completely untrue. The "negativity bias" has to do with us remembering things we perceive to be negative more than positive things and corresponds more to the human avoidance of the feeling of fear. Fear doesn't affect your reading of information unless it directly affects you. It also doesn't explain the feelings of excitement or anticipation you get when accepting positive information.

The keyword in your CMV that I’m going to latch onto is the word “deserve”.

Some of the punishments received by people in various countries are cruel to say the least. Often the degree of gruesomeness is hard or impossible to fathom for anyone who hasn’t experienced it. Others in the thread have already mentioned that people in Singapore (and Malaysia) receive caning (a form of torture) for some crimes. North Korea is the epitome of cruel and unusual punishment, placing people in concentration camps for the rest of their lives *and the next three generations after them*, where they have insufficient access to food, no access to information, no entertainment, virtually no interaction with other prisoners, and virtually no free time from hard, slavelike physical labor.

The view that you have expressed is that anyone who goes to a country and breaks one of its laws, even unknowingly or accidentally, *deserves* this form of punishment, and the only reason you’ve stated for that is that one could have known beforehand what one was in for.

If you honestly believe that, then you shouldn’t mind if your home country also started administering such punishments, or you would be inconsistent. After all, here in the “western world”, we clearly lay out the fate that awaits anyone who breaks the law, so you always know what you’re in for when you commit a crime, right?

But you know that European and North American countries do not, in general, make use of such inhumane sentences. Why is that? It’s because their population (largely) believes that, as human beings, we *do not deserve* certain kinds of treatment, *even after committing a crime*. The kinds of gruesome punishments I’m thinking of are considered to be *in violation of human rights*, and criminals are humans too. Logically, you don’t stop being a human when you go to another country, so it would be a double-standard to say that a certain punishment would be *deserved* over there but not over here.

Now, (most of) the population of (most) western countries believes this *even about criminals who have committed heinous acts against their fellow humans*. Your CMV, however, is not even about heinous crimes, but about political activism and religious proselytization, both acts in which other humans *aren’t even being hurt*. Any reasonable human being in their right mind would not consider a jail sentence to be a commensurate punishment for such an action, much less for it to be *deserved*. The reason those governments jail you for it is because of political circumstances (e.g. corruption) and not because they really believe you morally *deserve* it.

You may have seen recent viral video that aims to fight street harassment: “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman” (http://youtu.be/b1XGPvbWn0A)

While there are some instances of harassment in that video, I think that calling compliments and greetings “harassment” serves nobody:

1. It is not respectful to real victims of harassment, because it trivializes the issue.

2. It disrupts normal social dynamics between people.

3. It is not in the interest of women that want to meet somebody that men are being discouraged to approach them.

4. It will not deter creepy guys from harassing women, because apparently they don’t have any problem even with real harassment.

[Radical feminists think that approaching a woman you don’t know should automatically be characterized as harassment.]* That is the most counterproductive and retarded way to deal with the problem of harassment the world has ever seen.

-

P.S.: Because I was so astounded by the stupidity of this video I made a parody video, featuring Pepé Le Pew (http://youtu.be/j54AUhgByRY). If you want to see some real harassment, watch a few Pepé Le Pew cartoons.

I do believe there is a series of points that may counter this:  
  
First, I don't believe your 'polling' should be taken at face value as representing the average atheist. Even if the average atheist wasn't willing to change their views in light of certain arguments or evidence doesn't mean that their position is not falsifiable.  
  
Your point, I believe when put more succinctly, is that if atheists were logically consistent, then their skepticism would not allow anything to ever be evidence of God, any more so than 'x matrix style theory'.  
  
You seem to admit evidence of God would otherwise falsify an atheistic position if it were not for the 'equally as likely competing matrix theory'.

Lets, for now, assume all 'matrix style theories' were proven false somehow, leaving the question entirely of whether or not a God is responsible for our reality.  
  
If God was proven to exist through some hypothetical method it would obviously prove strong atheists wrong because they say there is no God. For Soft atheists, they do not say there is no God, but that it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a God. Obviously, again, proving God exists proves them wrong.  
  
In both cases, if it was entirely about God proving himself, regardless of alternative theories, atheism would be falsifiable if it could be established that there is reason to believe in God.  
  
This is important because it helps establish the only thing blocking, according to your thesis, atheism from being falsifiable, and that's the fact that no evidence, no matter how logical or blatant could disprove the possibility that everything is a false reality. So, in order to show that atheism is falsifiable, we must prove that reality is real... or merely that its unreasonable to think otherwise.  
  
I would wager, without official resources or citations at my disposal, that the average atheist actually would find the idea of God existing more reasonable than the matrix theory. We use many justifications for why our perceived reality can be reasonably taken at fact value. Basically, we assign more logical stock in 'reality' than we do the idea that it's false. This can be demonstrated in our behavior. We behave in such a way that we are betting on reality being real and relevant. We never hold the 'matrix theory' as being on equal terms as math, science, or our perceptions. As such, it would be dishonest, if God was demonstrated via math, science, or our perception, to all of a sudden assign equal value to the 'matrix' theory. If God was proven by logic, our perception, science, or math, then if we are being consistent, we would not choose the matrix theory over the God proof, thus making atheism, in all its forms, falsifiable.  
  
However, this is only if we go off of how the average atheist thinks (and I believe I safely assume the average atheist bets on reality being real each day). I, earlier pointed out that a position being falsifiable is not reliant on how the group would react (if honest), but instead is based on what the 'logically' consistent course is.  
  
By that I mean, what if we are wrong to value perceived reality as being on a greater level than the matrix theory? Many would say that would be wrong indeed, making my entire point refuted at this point. I only pointed out that atheists, (all people actually) behave as if this debate between reality and the matrix has long been settled. That doesn't mean it actually is. If atheists cannot logically show why reality is more logical to conclude than any 'matrix theory' then it would indeed appear that no matter how convincing God is in this reality, it could all just as easily be dismissed as illusion.  
  
What we have demonstrated in this, is that there is an inconsistent use of your word 'falsifiable'. If atheism cannot be falsified because of 'the matrix' then in this same method, nothing ever could be falsified.  
  
It appears, even for this question to be asked, we much assume several things. First, we must assume logic is the best determination for 'truth'. For anything to be false or true, there must be some agreed method to determine such qualities. I assume logic, and all it entails, is the method we are using.  
  
As such, anything that can be logically concluded as true is to be considered true. If the matrix was true, then nothing else could be, at least in the way we mean it. At this point we accept logic and all of its conclusions. So if we accept that your question means anything, then we acknowledge logic as being a valid determination of truth quality. Therefore, because logic can determine what is true or false, then a God proven true or false via a logically valid and sound method would falsify atheism.  
  
Further complicating matters is if you say that God cannot be proven true via logic, either because he does not exist, or because his nature prevents such a thing. In this case, atheism is only not falsifiable because it is true in one sense or another. If God does not exist, then both atheism, strong and soft are true. If God eludes the ability to be concluded logically, then the soft atheist is right in claiming God cannot be logically concluded.  
  
Only then is not being falsifiable a flaw if all correct claims are not flawed because they two are not falsifiable. No true claim can actually be falsifiable without creating a contradiction.  
  
**TL;DR**  
  
In conclusion, if anything can be falsified, then the 'matrix theory' is irrelevant, otherwise it would prevent every position ever taken to be not falsifiable. For the same reason a scientific theory can be falsified without invoking 'the matrix' so can the atheist's claim. If you do hold that the matrix theory prevents atheism from being falsifiable, and therefore every other position possible, then it being not falsifiable is irrelevant.  
  
Finally, if logic is a sufficient determination of truth, then atheism can only be not falsifiable, in a sense, if its true, meaning its impossible to falsify that which is true. It does, not, though, follow that all things not falsifiable are true.  
  
Verdict: Only an intellectually dishonest atheist would use the matrix theory to escape what would otherwise be proof of God.

&gt; Apart from religion, Christmas to me means ‘family’, and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family. I see grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles that I normally don’t get to see throughout the year. I also get to spend more quality time with my immediate family, which is sometimes hard to do with busy schedules.

Plenty of families do this on other times of year, Christmas is not unique in this respect. For example, Thanksgiving or even Chanukah and holidays of other religions. There's nothing about this which is unique to Christmas.

&gt; To many people, Christmas is about the presents, and although that shouldn’t be the main point, I would never deny the fact that it is fun receiving gifts from people who are close to you, and vice versa I enjoy giving people I love gifts and seeing their excitement upon opening them.

Again, this is not unique to Christmas.

&gt; I love the story behind the commercialized version of Christmas, including Santa Clause and his reindeers and elves. I especially enjoy watching Christmas movies about Santa and all other Christmas movies in general.

Many people hate this and highly dislike it and see it as a bastardization of Christmas and while some families have this tradition many do not. This is more of a personal preference than anything else.

&gt; I don’t know anyone who doesn't get into the spirit of Christmas when they hear a Christmas song, and I love when radio stations only play Christmas tunes for the holiday.

As someone who doesn't celebrate Christmas, I find the complete and total saturation of Christmas over everything (tv, radio, decorations) for the entire month of december (and fast encroaching on the end of November) to be annoying as hell. Particularly because there are several other holidays of other religions which happen during the same time of year but these are all ignored in favor of Christmas. Growing up Jewish, it sucked because almost no one puts up Chanukah decorations except for some on jewish households. You don't see stores with Happy Chanukah signs, but see Merry Christmas everywhere. It's very alienating. Hearing a Christmas song brings up these feelings of alienation for me rather than any sort of "Christmas Spirit" which is simply again labeling a general concept of goodwill and gift giving as "christmas" rather than recognizing it as relevant to many holidays.

&gt; Lastly, I love decorating the Christmas tree and the house with lights and ornaments and wreaths. It creates a magical experience going down the streets and seeing everything lit up against the snow.

Honestly, I don't think it's possible to change your view as this is entirely a personal preference. Nothing you've put here is any objective reason for how Christmas is "the best holiday". Everything you've stated is only true for a subset of people and there are plenty of people who would disagree with it. Can you give any *objective* reason for why Christmas is the best holiday?

Every time I see a commercial for the Dove “Real Beauty” campaign I get rather annoyed an offended. These commercials portray women who are supposed to represent what “real beauty” is. The eight or nine women featured are of average height and vary in skin tones, but are all “curvy”. None of them are what people would consider skinny or thin. I don’t think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit, nor would anyone say they are obese. 

My issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are, you’re beautiful and should love your body. That being said, this commercial shows one type of body, rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight. 

Is real beauty not being thin, even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods? Is real beauty not being athletic or strong or muscular? Are we saying that it’s okay to have extra fat on your bodies because “no matter what size you are, you’re beautiful”? 
I realize that many people can’t help what size they are no matter what they do, and I’m not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either, and I don’t agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight. What I don’t support is companies saying that real beauty is being round and curvy when in actuality, that may not be very healthy and shouldn't be settled for. 

I think women should try and be their best self, fit, healthy, active, and strong. I think these women should be praised and promoted. Although everyone should be confident in their own skin and should never dislike who they are, I don’t think it’s okay to except being overweight because “real women have curves”. 

FYI: I am a female, 5’8” and weigh around 130 lbs. I run cross country in college so I’m fairly active.

When my cousin was 15 and I went to her house, I was absolutely appalled that she addressed her mother by her first name instead of “mom.” Calling your parents “mom” or “dad” isn’t just a sign of respect; it is sign of love as well. “Mom” and “Dad” are titles that parents have earned by having and raising kids. Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect. 
Another time I was very bothered by someone not calling their parents “mom” or “dad” is when my friend was talking about something nice her mom did and addressed her by her first name in the story. Regardless of the setting, you should continue to call your parents “mom” and “dad” to show your ongoing respect for them whether you’re out of the house or out with friends.
I also believe that using “Mr” and “Mrs” when addressing those older than you or authority figures is an absolute must. I also know of people who prefer being addressed by just their first name because the title “Mr” or “Mrs” makes them “feel old.” They have insisted that even children as young as 5 call them by their first name.  Feeling old is fantastic in my opinion! It is also a natural part of life, but it is also something that one should be proud of. It shows that you have lived and you are wiser than I am. It shows your level of knowledge is far beyond mine and that you deserve respect from me.  Furthermore, this also creates a problem later in life when children make calling adults and respected figures with higher statuses than them a habit. It is so disrespectful and hurts those who have earned these titles that demand respect.

NOTE: I am addressing the matter of people who prefer to have titles before their names and children who repeatedly forget to use the title or ignore the title altogether. Also, just because I think adults deserve respect for being adults DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT RESPECT CHILDREN. I love children and hope to dedicate my life to them as a pediatric nurse. I am also 18 so I am writing this from the perspective of a child as opposed to an adult.

NOTE #2: My title and thesis for this post was too rigid. If i could rename it, I would omit the words "never" and "always." I understand that each individual has different preferences and respect that, but I am mainly speaking of people who prefer to be addressed with a title and who aren't addressed with that title. I also understand that complicated family situations cannot be applied to the title thing.

College cafeterias all claim to have ‘healthy options’ for students but I believe that a) the options aren’t any better for you than any other meal option available, and b) the healthy options need to be improved. Some college students, like myself, normally eat foods that are minimally processed have great health benefits. When they go off to college and have to eat at a dining hall, they are restricted and forced to eat rather unhealthily compared to their normal lifestyle. The ‘healthy options’ in college cafeterias are not good enough. They should be consistently filled with grilled chicken, quinoa, brown rice, natural peanut butter, smoothie options, and REAL steamed vegetables. Currently, they’re just full of processed meats and frozen vegetables. One of our dining halls here at The University of Mighigan was just recently redone and spent around 60 million doing so. If they can afford the coolest new chairs I’m sure they can afford better healthy food. 	The quality and amount of healthy options needs to be fixed.

Being the college freshmen that I am, I have very recent experience with the financial side to college. I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This, however, is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was “based on financial need.“ My academic and philanthropic resume didn’t matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. 
	
I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldn’t.  However, there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government, and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college.

Corporate Personhood is a legal concept where corporations have the same rights as “people” under the 14th amendment. 

&gt; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, &gt; without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
&gt; jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 

This part of the 14th amendment was written with the emancipation of slaves in mind after the civil war. I think the he word “person” in this part of the 14th amendment has been warped and skewed in order to give corporations power; power that frankly, I do not think corporations need or should have.

I think that the concept of Corporate Personhood is not beneficial to the people of the United States as a whole. In my view, the words of the constitution should not so easily be interpreted and reinterpreted to fit the needs of a few.
Here’s a quick video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no8zxGPyapU

That being said, I am absolutely open to having my opinion changed, BUT, I won’t do so lightly! So… What do you got?!

&gt;We were surprised to discover that **being within a few feet of a smoker outdoors may expose you to air pollution** levels that are comparable, on average, to indoor levels that we measured in previous studies of homes and taverns," said Wayne Ott, professor (consulting) of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and co-author of the JAWMA study. "For example, if you're at a sidewalk café, and you sit within 18 inches of a person who smokes two cigarettes over the course of an hour, your exposure to secondhand smoke could be the same as if you sat one hour inside a tavern with smokers. Based on our findings, a child in close proximity to adult smokers at a backyard party also could receive substantial exposure to secondhand smoke."

All you have to do is be about six or more feet away and none of this matters. You seems to imply that no smoker should ever smoke in a public outdoor area, but if that smoker is say 10 feet away from all other people, then it is perfectly fine to smoke in that public area.

Take your argument from the flip side. Environment cannot cause mental illness because two people exposed to the same environment will not both develop mental illness. It only happens to someone if they have a certain genetic predisposition.  
  
I think both arguments are equally strong, which tells me that neither factor alone is meaningful, but that both must be considered in tandem to understand the genesis of mental illness.
ERROR:
Its not that simple. Many of the environmental effects that eventually lead to mental illness take place in the womb before the person is even born. Though I understand that when most people think of "environment" they think of how your parents treated you growing up, a lot of "environmental effects" are biochemical and take place during fetal development. Insofar as we don't understand the exact details of what is going on, there is not much that we can do about that either.   
  
Furthermore, most of what happens to you as a child is entirely out of your control. Even though you or your parents may strive to provide you with the healthiest environment possible, things happen that can't be predicted, and parents may have issues of their own that they accidentally pass on to their children. I think you are really overestimating the amount of control we have over our environements. By the time we are adults and we can choose what to surround ourselves with, it may be too late to prevent the symptoms of mental illness from appearing, though we may become better at controlling them.  
  
Finally, if everyone's environment were equalized and optimized, then 100% of the cause of mental illness would be genetic. This is just the nature of heritability. If the environment doesn't differ at all then all differences in people are due to genes. What this demonstrates to me is that both must play an equal role if we are to have a full understanding of the problem. It just so happens that at this point in time environments vary more widely than genes so environmental effects are more obvious.

The main reason I hate expression of religion (and mostly organized expression of religion) is because of the prejudices it can cause. I believe religion is thé main cause of homofobia and a strong factor in other forms of discrimination. Just because religion tells them so people ostracize the things their religion tells them to or even just anyone who disagrees.

Yes this might be very black-and-white viewed, but so much discrimination is and/or was brought forth out of religion. So much times has it been abused for it´s power of organizing people, crusades, wars, genocides. One can´t think about WWII (the strong nationalism back then can easily be considered as a sort of religion in my opinion) without the genocide of the jews, homosexuals and mentally handicapped or anyone who disagreed with them. Or for example the Islamic State.

I know religion has also done good things but to me it seems they don´t even come close to weighting out the bad.

Especially as a gay man I can´t talk to a religious person without having a tenfolded fear of how they will respond when they know I´m gay.

My view feels very toxic and hateful, but I have difficulty changing it.

You hear of this word a lot all over the news and by our political representatives especially since 9/11.  A ‘terrorist’ is a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims. But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group? Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide? 

The problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end. It is the perfect war. Perfect for growing the military industrial complex adding to the increase of mass surveillance, police militarization, drone strikes, and innocents being accused, imprisoned or killed. It is a true modern day witch-hunt. There will always be a ‘terrorist’ because terrorism is an ideology. But as the years go by the word is being more and more loosely defined. 

By using the word terrorism to fight our enemies, it has completely sheepified the population. It simply is a lot easier to get your way as a politician if you use it. In reality there is no black and white. The truth is people have different interests; to them they are freedom fighters, and heroes fighting for their values. We are probably even considered a terrorist to our terrorists. It is clear the war on terror has failed and has led nowhere besides a never-ending cycle of fighting fire with fire or violence for violence. Lets take a new perspective. Lets start educating each other about our different viewpoints and cultures. Lets once and for all end the use of the words ‘terrorism, and terrorist’. Instead lets work towards a greater understanding of the world and each other. The end of the never-ending war starts with investment in education not the latest high tech weaponry.  

ERROR:
No, of course not. When you use words from another language, you say it like that language, unless it's so old as to have been subsumed into your language (see: British English "strand" vs German "Strand"); in the case of Kindergarden, you've even changed the spelling (though I don't believe that spelling is correct). When you say "quesadilla" or "joie de vivre" or "Fahrvergnügen," you approximate the original word as best you can, because for that moment, you are no longer speaking English. If your accent is imperfect, that's ok, but to do anything less than your best is rhe same as Napoleon Dynamite's grandma. This is a two way street, mind you: Hispanics should prounounce IPod as best they can; never change it to "EePod," it's "HayPod," an American product.

They must prevent any foul play with the future of the upcoming generations and anything that could cause loss to society. The masses are part of them and they are part of the masses.

Members of the Islamic Resistance Movement should share the people's joy and grief, adopt the demands of the public and whatever means by which they could be realised.

&gt; Ignoring for a moment the fact that this seems a questionable action of a “good” god

In Christianity, anything that does not follow God's will is a sin, and sin is punishable by death. "Death" as it was used in the original Greek (thánatos) means separation, in this case from God's perfect glory. God set up a system where people who follow his commands and do not sin will be granted eternal closeness with God (heaven). Humans are incapable of living a sin free life however, so Jesus died to pay the price for people's sins allowing them access to God and heaven. So, when Satan rejected God's power and attempted to use the authority that God gave him for his own purposes instead of obeying God, Satan and his followers were cast out of heaven, being separated from God because of their sin.

&gt; although there is very little information about Lucifer's fall from heaven in the bible

Most of the information regarding Satan's fall can be found in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Job, and Genesis. The most apparent reason that Satan was cast out was because of his pride. I think the two conclusions you drew that either heaven is not perfect or God is not omnipotent ignores the desire for power that Satan has.

Isaiah 14:12-14
12 	“How you are fallen from heaven,
O Day Star, son of Dawn!
How you are cut down to the ground,
you who laid the nations low!
13 	You said in your heart,
I will ascend to heaven;
above the stars of God
I will set my throne on high;
I will sit on the mount of assembly
in the far reaches of the north;
14 	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
I will make myself like the Most High.’

Here Satan wishes to become like God with all of his knowledge and power, but obviously his inability to do this shows how his power is not sufficient to overthrow God. Satan rejected heaven not because it was imperfect but because he wanted to be the master of heaven. He was not content being the highest of angels and his lust for power drove him to rebel.

It is widely agreed upon that God wanted to create humanity to have people CHOOSE to love him, not be forced to obey him like a slave. This free will applies to the angels that he created as well. Lucifer chose to pursue power over obedience and was cast out as a result.

In the end, it is God who created the universe and attempts to instruct humans to chose his glory over the temptation of Lucifer. Worshiping Lucifer when it is God who chooses who goes to heaven or is cast away seems like a terrible idea.

Additionally, theistic Satanists do not believe that Satan is omnipotent. They view him as a supernatural patriarch. They acknowledged that God is the creator of the universe and choose to rebel against him for various reasons, be it anger, desire for power, desire for pleasure, or just to rebel. Considering that even those who worship Satan view him as less powerful than God and are aware that they will go to hell, following Satan seems unappealing.

Given that there are two options:
A) Worship God who is acknowledged by both parties to be omnipotent and creator of the universe, offers a way to be close to him yet still allows choice on the mater, and provides a place that allows everyone who obeys him to be close to the most supreme thing that ever has, does, or will exist
or
B) Worship a rebellious high ranking and less powerful creature who displays greed as his most prominent trait, provides short term benefits and long term damnation, and is ignorant or stupid enough to try and defeat the most powerful thing that can exist

Worshiping God over Satan is the better choice.

**"Most" older games are not referred to as classics though.  Most older games DON'T stand the test of time, and are forgotten.**  
     
And yes, there are definitely some games that everybody acts like are still great, when they actually would be shitty (today) without nostalgia.  Probably the best example of this is Goldeneye 64, a great game at the time that people feel a lot of nostalgia for, but is almost objectively bad by any modern standard.  But I don't think that applies to all "classics."    
    
But try looking at the issue in reverse.  There are some modern games which are well received despite the fact that they don't really push the envolope in terms of modern technology.  Or they have some nice graphics, but they aren't games where graphics are critical, and the rest of the game could have been made years ago.    
    
I mean like at Starcraft II.  It was very popular, despite the fact that it's not really modern.  Even at release, it was basically a ten year old game with a bit more polish and some graphics boost.  Or league of legends, one of the most popular games in the world.  I'm not a computer expert, but I'm guessing it's not exactly pushing the envelope of modern technology.  The graphics aren't groundbreaking to begin with, and the game would be almost the exact same experience with older graphics. And the rest of it doesn't seem advanced at all.    
     
I mean I havn't played the newer smash bros very much, but other than looking better, are the significantly technologically improved from smash bros 64?    
    
______     
    
That being said, if your point is just "people only think some older classics are good because of nostalgia goggles," well that view can't really be changed because it borders on fact rather than opinion.    
     
Although you do seem to be implying a game has to hold up to modern standards to be a classic, which I strongly disagree with.  Yeah, Goldeneye sucks by modern standards, but it's still a classic for how good it was at the time.   I mean I'm no car expert, but aren't many "classic" antique cars objectively worse than similar quality modern cars?

I can tell you from personal experience that many states are much like, if not worse than NY. I grew up in upstate NY, spent 4 years in Southeast VA, and have now been in Seattle for 3ish years.  
  
Northern VA (basically greater DC) is a 100% different state than southern or western VA, ask anyone who lives in either area.    
  
Washington state would blow your mind.  We have the greater Seattle area is far western WA , Spokane in far eastern WA.  In between theres a whole lot of nothing (I.e. desert and small towns.). WA doesn't even have cities like Rochester, Syracuse, Buffalo, Albany or even an Ithaca.  
  
So, I'd argue that, by your logic most states should be split up.  Once there were split up you'd be left with distinct red/blue divisions with undertones not unlike the North vs. South divisions we see today hundreds of years after the civil war.  
  
Further, you'd remove quality diversity, let alone tourist revenue and other benefits the large metro areas bring to an entire state.    
  
So, that's my take on your view. Hope it helps!

The Palestinians made themselves become the ultimate victim. And considering their status they truly are.  
The problem is that their status is mostly caused by lots of different causes most of which aren't talked about on the world news because it's easier to see good guys and bad guys even if the situation is much more complex.  
I'll give you a couple of reasons the Palestinians have it this bad that are much worse (in my opinion) than the Israeli government.
  
1) Hamas - Hamas is a terrorist organisation known by most of the western world as such.  
It holds full control of the Gaza strip and it got it's power by force (when Israel left the Gaza strip and surrounding areas a political party called the Fatah was democratically chosen to be in charge. they were driven out by force, having most of it's high ranking members killed and their bodies dragged through the streets.)
The Hamas organization only wants the complete destruction of the state of Israel to establish an Islamic State just like the one currently forming in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), this organization doesn't care about the Palestinian people, and it actually uses them as human shield and as propaganda machine (there are accounts of Hamas invading a civilian house for launching rockets from it, killing the resident family in the process and then blaming the IDF for doing it.)  
The point you have to realize is that Hamas is at war with Israel, and the Palestinians are kept hostages in the middle of it all.

2) Other mid-east countries and the U.N - after Israel's independents war, there were a lot of Palestinian refugees fleeing to countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt (thinking the small newborn state o Israel has no chance to survive this war raged against 3 enemy states. and believing that soon they will return to their abandoned homes.)
these refugees are in that status for well over 60 years and no-one is trying to change that. they have their own special status in the U.N. unlike any refugee in any other part in the world, controlled by the corrupt UNRWA controlled by the states they are currently in.
They have practically no rights for labor, travel and free speech.
They are trapped in the status of refugee and can't change it, furthermore, them and all descendants of them are defined as refugees as well.  
This is also, to make them seem like the victims (which they are) and then blame it on Israel, otherwise how could they paint it as an evil state that must be eliminated?

3) Corrupt leaders - Even though the state of things in the west bank is far better than whats happening in Gaza, things could be much better.  
The west bank gets millions of dollars in donations and foreign aid to help their institutions and education, these funds never reach their destination and remains in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians. When children have an almost wrecked school, The principle of said school lives in a palace of a house, with money received in education aid.  

Currently the situation for the Palestinians is awful and there are a lot of different reasons for it. but the main reason is because for a lot of powerful people usually in the arab world, there are agendas to be obtained and for that to happen the Palestinians need to look like victims. So they'll stay in the victim status, no matter what Israel does to try and change it.
ERROR:
You are blaming people for errors that are rooted in ignorance with the same assignment of fault as if that person were consciously and actively aware of several options and proceeding with their error fully aware of the transgression.   
         
A person cannot reasonably be faulted for errors born of their own ignorance because they do not even know they are committing a mistake, and it is simply egotistical and immature to reprimand a person for not knowing some piece of information that the person doing the chastising happens to posses.    
            
Information and data itself is transient and fluid and not the substance of an individual's character but the product of their environment; if a person acts upon incorrect information it is almost universally true that the bad data was passed to them by someone else they trusted.    
            
The world is abundant with information and schools of thought and knowledge that teem with data and trivia and facts that you have no working grasp of, and it is likely every day in other realms of information you make the same mistake you are chastising- and you do not even know it.    
          
Consider when someone who possess great amounts of correct knowledge in any school you barely understand interacts with you when you happen to make an error in the field of their strengths- what does it accomplish when they treat you as though you had some personal flaw or character fault of weakness because of some minor error, aside from making them look like an ass that cares too much about some unimportant triviata and needs to get a life?    
       
Or, conversely, when someone takes the time to show you your error without treating your ignorance as though it were stupidity, and then leads you to the correct information so you can replace your flawed data with proper knowledge?     
         
Ignorance is not a character flaw or weakness or fault; it is a trait we all possess and it is absurd and hypocritical for any of us to try to claim another person's ignorance is an active, cognizant transgression.
ERROR:
What you've done here is called 'moving the goalposts.' Nowhere in your initial post do you mention- not once- any focus on these specific situations (teacher, politician, etc) you respond with- or ever even hint that these very specific circumstances are in any way the substance of your view.   
         
Because the point I made is overwhelmingly true, and from the general argument you made to the general rebuttal I responded with there is little to no foundation in the general argument on your side to refute my rebuttal, you can only reply with detailing specific situations that you have tailored to fit as a suitable response: suffice to say, while I could refute these specific points, (you are presenting variants of the Nirvana fallacy and nothing more) it is more academically important to rebuke your response by highlighting that your rebuttal is invalid as it intentionally misrepresents the nature of my writing.   
            
I wrote a general reply to your general argument; your response portrays the exceptions (specific situations that neither relate to your initial position nor are even mentioned as topical in any way) that prove my rule as though they were the focus of the discussion.    
          
Beyond that, however, your claim that ignorance is an active transgression, doesn't even hold up to scrutiny or critical analysis, and is a sort of Nirvana fallacy variant- there is no teacher, politician or voter that can possess absolute, infallible and omniscient knowledge in regards to their respective topics: at some point ignorance influences each of them. What we have developed in response is *reasonable expectation of competence* from each of these, to be evaluated case by case- which in the end refutes your general argument which you began with.    
             
&gt; ignorance is an active, cognizant transgression. It is an act of recklessness and irresponsibility.   
           
No, it simply isn't. It is ignorant to think so.

We should make welfare much harder to get because it is allowing large corporations to pay their employees $7 an hour because they can go out and get welfare to supplement their income. I do think that it would get pretty bad for those people for a couple of years, as businesses would be reluctant to raise wages, but if we made welfare much much harder to be eligible for, businesses would be forced to pay their employees more because without any kind of social programs to fall back on, people simply couldn't work for the amount they are currently being paid. 
		
When I say that "Welfare" should be much harder to get, I'm talking about supplemental help, not disability or anything like that.

My position relies on these points:
 
*The Bell Curve- The Bell Curve is a 1998 scientific book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles A. Murray, in the book a racial IQ gap is described that has prominent races in the allowing order(from least intelligent to most): blacks, whites, Asians, jews. Subsequent books have been published by Murray supporting his data. 

*Minnesota Transracial Adoption Studies- This study had adopted children of White, black, asian, and mixed decent take IQ test at age 7 and 17, not surprisingly the white children scored highest, then mixed, and finally black. Interestingly mixed children, wether raised to believe they were black or mixed scored the same, which strongly implies IQ is hereditary. This study was also done by a group of people who considered themselves racial equalist. 

*Arthur Jensen studies- during these test blacks and whites were given a sequence of numbers to remember, and there scores were about the same; however, when they asked to repeat the numbers backwards, the blacks did significantly worse. 

*African civilizations have done substantially worse than european civilizations, additionally sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest mean IQ score, bordering on retarded

*The brain of the average black has been shown to have differences for the brain of the average white or Asian man.

ERROR:
&gt; First and foremost I want to define “felon” as someone who has actually committed a felony

Okay, so then the severity of this depends on the severity of those things classified as felonies.

&gt; we are debating whether or not people who have been removed from society for committing heinous crimes should be granted the right to vote.

No we're not.  We're debating whether people convicted of a felony should have a right to vote.

&gt; We have removed these people from society specifically because they have committed crimes that are highly destructive of society in general.

This is divorced from the *actual* definition of felony, as used in our legal systems.  Often, it means a serious crime generally.  In the US, it's a crime that could have more than a 1 year sentence.  *Could*, not *will*.  So a judge might decide that an individual's particular case *isn't* very serious, and it won't fit this criteria.  Really calls into question the objectiveness of the designation.  It certainly doesn't reflect your own idealism.

&gt; I hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.

The most common US felonies are drug offenses, arson, forgery, fraud, and property offenses.

I categorically disagree with you when it comes to drug offenses.  To a lesser extent, I find fraud and property offenses to be debatable.  However, you should really take note of what is *not* in this list.  Assault, rape, murder, and those things *are not the most common* felonies.  Your thinking is not targeting rapists and murderers.

&gt; This is a diagnosis that falls just below all-out psychopathy— a diagnosis that 20% of prison inmates carry.

Inmates, not felons.  That's a selection bias.  Inmates with longer sentences are more likely to be selected for the survey, if we're taking a random sample *of people currently in prison*.

This is somewhat of a betrayal of your own premise, because the right to vote is only a topic for those who are already *out* of prison.  This group has the reverse bias - those with lighter sentences, who served their time early, and stayed out of prison, are more heavily represented in the population of felons who are living in society.  The subset who are *trying to vote* are subject to an even greater bias, with the most repentant and productive of them turning out to the polls.  Your numbers are not speaking for that group.

&gt; It seems outrageous to me that people who have no regard for the rights of others should be allowed direct involvement in a practice that affects laws and policy.

And we come back to drug offenders.  For felonies, these are more *likely* to be dealers, but users are also stuck with felony charges.  The law is only concerned with what quantity and material they're caught with.  It doesn't have to be proved beyond a doubt that they're dealing.

So your statements are awfully bold, applied to drug users and dealers, who are the main group you're talking about.  Should their crimes be felonies in the first place?  Maybe not.  But as long as they are, it's a label that isn't useful for what you're using it for.

People usually do it because they're taught that not doing it would be considered "weird", "wrong", "abnormal", etc.  
  
That really seems to be about it.  
  
Personally, as a male who has trimmed his beard seven times in thirteen years, and the crown locks less than that, I don't care what people do or don't do with their assorted body hair.  My SO, being a hippy-type, doesn't shave her legs or pits, and I'm completely fine and comfortable with that.  
  
I by no means intend to suggest that I consider it "wrong" or "abnormal" or "weird" for people to cut/trim/shave their hairs... so long as they do it for their own reasons, and not merely because they're expected to by a nebulous Society-At-Large.  As [Crayshack](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/27nxly/cmv_removing_body_hair_is_painful_and_pointless/ci2o2dq) shows, competitive swimmers by far benefit from an overall lack of hair across the body.... though I suspect his stated belief in finding hair in general to be gross a probable result in his having spent so much of his life with so little hair on himself.
ERROR:
I'm going to get pretty abstract here, so bear with me. If we start with the assumptions that there are no greater beings which dictate the purpose of life or human existence, and that the most powerful paradigm is the one which provides the most personal happiness while minimizing contradictions, then it seems that a complete amorality is the strongest secular position. I'll use a simple example to explain why I think so:
  
A man is faced with the choice: whether or not to gain $1,000,000 and bring about the instant death of a random person he does not know. A moral man would be at a serious dilemma. He must choose between what he believes to be right (protecting human life) and his selfish desires (to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.) The man must sacrifice either his own happiness or his moral principle at this juncture. An amoral man would not be at a loss; he would not think twice about taking the money and would overall be happier with himself for doing so than the moral man.
  
These points of cognitive dissonance are a serious hindrance to an individual's happiness. No one likes the feeling of choosing between one good thing and another. The person would prefer, whether he knows it or not, to receive one without knowledge of the other. Barry Schwartz talked about this in his book The Paradox of Choice. In the same respect, an amoral man is happier with his life and his decisions than a moral man, who frets over the best way to go about doing things and must worry about both his own selfish interests and his moral principles. 
  
I have come to believe this wholeheartedly, but it seems to contradict with almost everyone's point of view, and I'm not confident enough to assume I'm right and (seemingly) the world is wrong. I don't ruthlessly pursue my own interests and in fact, many people would consider me a good person. I often enjoy helping people I respect and care for, even at great cost to myself, and my circumstances allow me to live more comfortably within the bounds of the law than I would if I were to become a criminal. However, I don't hold any moral principles. My only principle is to maximize my own enjoyment of life, and if someone were to offer me the hypothetical $1,000,000 briefcase, without fear of the legal consequences, I would probably take 1,000 and sleep like a baby afterwards. I don't see how adding morality to the equation of human existence provides more happiness for the individual; to me, it seems to lead to contradiction. A person's beliefs should serve him or her, not the other way around.

If you have a few drinks, you're not going to lose your mind. It takes a lot of alcohol to make a reasonable person completely lose control, and by that point they usually just pass out.

People are usually just trying to live up to the expectation of "drink and do dumb things" and show off for their friends. I've seen girls at a party acting drunk and trying to outdo each other, completely unaware that they were drinking non-alcoholic beer the whole time.

I agree with you when you say that volts makes more sense in *eletrostatics*. However you should consider the bigger picture of *electromagnetism*. The definition of ampère makes a lot of sense when you think about electrodynamics and magnetism.

The definition of fundamental units doesn't need to be practical as much as they need to be *reproducible* to incredibly *high accuracy*. You will use the definition much less often, to calibrate some "standard" equipment, and you should get it right no matter the cost. Then you will use this standard equipment much more often to calibrate other equipment in more practical ways.

Also, the definition doesn't describe exactly how the experiment must be carried, that's the experimental physicist's work. They are just a *guideline* everyone can agree upon. For example, you don't actually need two infinitely big wires, you just need two wires that are much longer than they are apart, and you divide the force you get by the length so you have force per one meter. 

As sidenote: You couldn't reliably define volt with something as non-fundamental as an eletrochemical battery, which vastly depends upon pressure, temperature and concentration and type of the reagents (all that also changes over time with the reaction).

**TLDR:** Apère makes more sense in the bigger picture of electromagnetism! The definition isn't crazy, just a guideline that is reproducible with large accuracy.

Handguns are, in many cases, historical artifacts—both as a general example of engineering from a time period and as a family heirloom.

Someone who collects World War II memorabilia has every reason to want a Beretta 1394, a Colt M1911A1, or a Walther P38, especially if they can tie it to a particular soldier. Someone who collects prohibition memorabilia has a reason to include a Colt Police .38 Special in their collection. Someone who collects Old West memorabilia probably doesn't have a complete collection unless they have a Colt Single Action Army. And even if you don't have a specific collection, the engineering and craftsmanship can be fascinating to examine.

The problem is the amount of guns that are in the US already, and the land border with Mexico. Countries such as the UK and Australia who have enacted gun control very successfully don't/didn't have these problems and so it was much easier. In the UK, I live in the city with the highest gun crime per population (shout out to Birmingham) and even then there are very few guns in the city, i knew a person who bought a gun and got imprisoned for it - he spent £300+ on it ($500 roughly) and it was a converted BB gun which probably would have blown his hand off if he'd used it. There are very few viable guns in the UK that aren't shotguns owned by farmers or gamekeepers, but this wouldn't be the case with the US, where there are millions of guns already, and not just old service revolvers either.

I feel that caffeinated soft drinks are more harmful than e-cigarettes, and yet they continue to be sold to and marketed to minors. Caffeine is an addictive substance, and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many long-term health problems including tooth decay, obesity, heart disease, liver failure, and diabetes. There is evidence to show that high fructose corn syrup is also an addictive substance. And the artificial sweeteners that can be used in its stead also come with their host of problems. Along with all the alarmist news stories about e-cigarette use increasing among high school students, I feel that the public should be every bit as outraged by products like Mountain Dew and Coca Cola being marketed to children and teenagers.﻿ 

The only active substances in the liquid used in an e-cigarette are nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine and flavour extracts. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine are all approved for public consumption by the FDA and are commonly used as food additives. Propylene glycol is commonly used in ice cream to keep it from going hard. The temperatures used in vaporizing the e-liquid are only enough to cause a phase change and far too low to cause combustion, which is where most of the harmful chemicals are formed when smoking tobacco.

The only reason why e-cigarettes are banned from sale to minors is due to the continuing stigma from the risks of smoking tobacco. Change my view: If we allow the sale of caffeinated soft drinks to minors, we should also allow the sale of e-cigarettes. And if we restrict one, we should then restrict the other.

Bill Nye does not need to list his honorary doctorate in order to get a job anywhere.  He can get a job somewhere because he's Bill Fucking Nye. An honorary degree is just that, an honor.

&gt;changing weather patterns  
  
Yes this will be a problem however the more serious issue is changing climate patterns, specifically regarding desertification. Soil for agriculture is a mix of different particles mainly sand and smaller more nutritious particles. When an area goes with out water for an extended time period, like California did recently, those small nutritious particles blow away. This could mean a dramatic decrease in crop yields all over the globe and probably loss of life because of food shortages as well.   
  
&gt;rising sea levels  
  
This is another problem that we'll be facing. While it is true that this won't effect everyone immediately or even close to the near future, it will effect a lot of people indirectly. Perhaps you saw that CNN crossfire with Bill Nye where the mentioned how a road in North Carolina, USA (I think) has to be raised a few feet because of rising sea levels (or at least in the future). This is just a small example of some infrastructure changes that will need to be implemented to accommodate for this. Housing for a lot of people will need to be relocated as well as the businesses and factories that are also in these zones.  
  
I would also argue that the biodiversity aspect is important, but that is a different CMV topic. So think of this economically. If there was any other type of problem that would result in loss of life, thousands of jobs, hundreds of thousands of homes, and reduced quality of life for those who weren't affected by the former, wouldn't you consider that a problem that should be addressed? Even more so, wouldn't you think it foolish of the people who knew this was coming and knew how to stop it in time but did nothing?

But is hell like an infinite punishment? Maybe hell is not a punishment for one's decision but merely the result of it. C. S. Lewis said, “I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside.” 

If you have infinite time to make a decision about whether or not to accept God, or if you could always reverse your decision, then the decision would not be mean anything because it wouldn't be binding. So suppose you are given only finite time to choose. 

But why does that decision have an *eternal* consequence? Perhaps because something about God's nature, or our relationship to Him, dictates that we can only turn Him down *once*. 

But then why can't those who go to Hell just cease to exist? Well, some people do hold such a view, called Annihilationism. Others hold that those who choose to deny God continue to exist as a shade-like state where they continue to hold onto their decision for eternity in Hell, always wanting to be there (as reflected in the C.S. Lewis quote). Maybe it has something to do with the idea of eternal separation of God.

Mind you, I do think that the problem of Hell is a serious one for Christianity, but I find other objections to Christianity more convincing. If you interested in more discussion about these debates, see this: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/

EDIT: Here is a more promising line of thought from Mark Johnston's book *Saving God*. (Don't let the title fool you, it is more of a redefinition of God as the universe.) In his book, he discusses cases where God seems to be allowed to do something immoral by human standards of morality because God has a fundamentally "higher" kind of moral authority. Johnston points out that, even if were believers, we could not know if we were talking to God or Satan or a demon except through our own reason and our own sense of morality, otherwise our ability to discern God from demon breaks down and we can no longer make sense of religious experience. (We would have no way of knowing if it was God, rather than a demon, that spoke to the prophets and inspired the writers of the Bible.) So maybe we can apply this idea here to say that, if a defense against the problem of Hell is going to work, it cannot appeal to an unknowably "higher" kind of morality.

ERROR:
I am liberal in the modern political sense of the word.  I don’t want to get into semantics so I’m not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neo-liberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American.  Since I love this subreddit I’ll provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down.  =)  I will change my view if you can show how ‘forward thinking, inclusivism, secularism, or personal liberty’ are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. 

WHAT IS LIBERALISM? 

1) 	Forward Thinking –  I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds.  Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like “tradition” and “maintaining order or status quo” which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups.  I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit.  I believe the abolition of slavery, suffrage of women, lax immigration policies, and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society.

2) 	Inclusivism – I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible.  I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual.  (ex: What good are ‘my’ rights if I only get them by infringing on others?)  I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights.  When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. (see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the 1930s and 2008 depressions).  

3) 	SECULARISM – I believe that governments and all non-religious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesn’t disenfranchise anyone.  I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs (ex: a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it, nor any business, should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees).  In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe ‘most’ liberals would.  I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by, grounded in, nor should it be regulated by, a religion.  (Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith.  I may have to accept partial blame for ‘radical hippies’ that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardy-cats.  It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the ‘average liberal’ supports these types of faith based anti-data claims then please hammer away at me).  


4) 	PERSONAL LIBERTY – The government is the primary protector of the citizen’s rights and liberties.  Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary.  Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity.  Free love, marrying whomever you chose, freedom of and from religion, 1st and 4th amendment rights, and the right to privacy, are all liberal ideas that I support.  I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others.  I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other.  “Separate but equal” is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.

Lightning round...

5) 2nd Amendment = pro gun ownership, pro heavy regulation

6) Big Government = globalization and big businesses need big  government support.  Remember only conservatives say "I demand big government get their hands off my medicare".

7) Taxes = The required big government needs big income.  Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined, but it cannot be halved or quartered.  

8) Climate Change = I side with science.  No, there is no debate.

9) Abortion = I can prove with science that the mother is alive.  Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.  

10) The Draft = Against it.  Unless America is facing a crisis of civilization ending proportions then there's no need to dilute a strong fighting force with people that don't want to be there.

I am liberal in the modern political sense of the word.  I don’t want to get into semantics so I’m not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neo-liberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American.  Since I love this subreddit I’ll provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down.  =)  I will change my view if you can show how ‘forward thinking, inclusivism, secularism, or personal liberty’ are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. 

WHAT IS LIBERALISM? 

1) 	Forward Thinking –  I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds.  Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like “tradition” and “maintaining order or status quo” which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups.  I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit.  I believe the abolition of slavery, suffrage of women, lax immigration policies, and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society.

2) 	Inclusivism – I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible.  I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual.  (ex: What good are ‘my’ rights if I only get them by infringing on others?)  I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights.  When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. (see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the 1930s and 2008 depressions).  

3) 	SECULARISM – I believe that governments and all non-religious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesn’t disenfranchise anyone.  I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs (ex: a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it, nor any business, should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees).  In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe ‘most’ liberals would.  I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by, grounded in, nor should it be regulated by, a religion.  (Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith.  I may have to accept partial blame for ‘radical hippies’ that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardy-cats.  It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the ‘average liberal’ supports these types of faith based anti-data claims then please hammer away at me).  


4) 	PERSONAL LIBERTY – The government is the primary protector of the citizen’s rights and liberties.  Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary.  Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity.  Free love, marrying whomever you chose, freedom of and from religion, 1st and 4th amendment rights, and the right to privacy, are all liberal ideas that I support.  I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others.  I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other.  “Separate but equal” is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.

Lightning round...

5) 2nd Amendment = pro gun ownership, pro heavy regulation

6) Big Government = globalization and big businesses need big  government support.  Remember only conservatives say "I demand big government get their hands off my medicare".

7) Taxes = The required big government needs big income.  Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined, but it cannot be halved or quartered.  

8) Climate Change = I side with science.  No, there is no debate.

9) Abortion = I can prove with science that the mother is alive.  Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.  

10) The Draft = Against it.  Unless America is facing a crisis of civilization ending proportions then there's no need to dilute a strong fighting force with people that don't want to be there.

Cold reasoning, but I take your point. I am actually a research scientist and talking from a purely science view point my concern with this is that the test subjects are already defective. You are testing drugs for reactions on subject that are already unfit. These will likely create even larger outliers and result in drugs being abandoned. Animal can be bread in clean conditions and are healthy before the trial begins. Although there are cases of certain species have certain reactions that humans don’t have this can be overcome by testing across multiple species this shouldn’t be over-exaggerated. Metabolically animals used in testing are very similar to humans and will largely react in similar ways, any species specific traits can be overcome by testing across multiple species. Maybe instead of getting rid of animals you should consider leaving that step in, the if that goes well test on healthy humans, if a drug is promising but has a reaction in a couple of test animals then try those out on “marginal” humans.
ERROR:
This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive,  then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas...  several kilos of food here for less than £4. if you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive)
ERROR:
Then that disqualifies you from the group “rich people” (assuming you don’t live in too ridiculous an apartment) 

Then it might be a completely different problem, where you are perhaps seen as a ‘poser’, trying to look like you are ‘fancier’ then you really are. 

I hope I don’t come off as judgmental, I am not saying these things about you, I am just spitballing different reasons people might have

ERROR:
Consciousness is *required* for happiness and what you do with your consciousness is up to you—you believe that consciousness leads to a curselike uncertainty, and you also say that there can be comfort in subscribing to a certain belief system. Does it not follow, if one can derive comfort from a belief system, that one can also derive discomfort from a belief system? I believe that's what you're doing with this belief system; your subscription to the belief that consciousness leads to a curselike uncertainty is leading you to discomfort. This is assuming something curselike is discomforting, but I hope this is a reasonable assumption.

You're deriving a visceral thing (negative emotions, curselikeness) from uncertainty, but doesn't an emotion felt say more about the person feeling it than the circumstances in which they feel the emotion? There are many emotional ways to react to any given situation.

Uncertainty need not cause negativity. Many tolerate the inherent uncertainty of sentience and manage to have happiness while being aware of the uncertainty of all knowledge.

I hope I could respond to your points.

Have you ever witnessed forty + people trying to do something together without leadership?  As others have explained, no matter how well-trained the musicians are, that doesn't automatically give them the ability to play together with everyone else when every musician has their own subtle ways of doing things.  
  
I think the best description I heard is that a conductor plays the orchestra the way each orchestra member plays their instrument.  
  
That's why the same piece of music can sound very different under two different conductors, and you will never find a recording done WITHOUT a conductor.  (If conductor's were just for show, why would they need them in a recording room anyways?)
ERROR:
That depend. Is the governments primary priority to do those things? Is it primarily to create jobs, stimulate the economy? The US Preamble disagrees. The government was formed with a plethora of roles. 
&gt;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
 
Does funding the humanities contribute to these goals? Those are the goals of government, in the United States at least. 

The role of the government funding in the humanities us primarily to counterbalance the economic concerns because we all agree that having a strong humanities base is integral to our success as a nation. 

Also, if you do want to look at it primarily as an investment,[the chronicle of higher education](http://chronicle.com/article/How-Liberal-Arts-Majors-Fare/144133/)  has reported that humanities grads to come out fairly well off in the long run. Their skills aren't economically valued right out of school, but they are important and because of this they do eventually become financially useful. Unfortunately, the beginnings of these productive careers aren't the most monetarily rewarding. The government subsidizes all kinds of things, is the subsidization of our nations ability to communicate and express itself that much of a waste?

ERROR:
**While I am not an advocate of equality of outcome, I do believe that there should be equality of opportunity.** This means that I believe harder work merits more money to spend on frivolities like fancy gadgets, exclusive vacations and surpassingly excellent food, drink, and housing, but that any two people – regardless of who their parents are or where they were born – ought to have the same chance to access these benefits if they work equally hard.

**I consider the rights I have outlined in this post’s title necessary for equality of opportunity to exist.** I do *not* suggest that any of these things should be mandatory, only *readily available* for those who are interested.

Here’s why:

* Living in an unsafe environment presents a serious distraction towards which an individual must divide a portion of their attention. This means that a given quantity of effort one person exerts focusing solely on their goals will have greater rewards than the *same quantity* of effort will elicit for another person who must allocate part of their energy towards simply staying alive. 
* Without access to nutritious food, an individual is at an immediate disadvantage: their brain development and physical health will be stunted, which serves to limit the rewards that hard work is capable of accomplishing. Also, in large part because of the lack of affordability of nutritious food ["people in America who live in the most poverty-dense counties are those most prone to obesity"](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667.full) which can cause a variety of diseases and other medical problems which all take energy and other resources away from attempts to be successful. 
* Unevenly distributed educational opportunities also prevent the same amount of energy from producing the same rewards. Every field requires knowledge that we are not born with. Education ought to maintain a balance between unlocking each individual’s unique passion, challenging them with thoughts from other fields which can provide ammunition for the synthesis necessary to be innovative and successful in their main field, and installing the basic literacy in a variety of subjects that is necessary for constructive participation in society.
* Given that the alternative to universal healthcare seems to be a choice for some between blowing their savings to get treatment and simply living untreated, both the medical problems which are systemic (like those caused by obesity) and the medical problems which are the product of random chance are going to more significantly impact people born into poverty, limiting their ability to see the same rewards for the same amount of effort.

ERROR:
But the physical entry requirements are not specific requirements to actually “do” the job. It’s not the same thing as a position requiring a certain specific degree, skill or certification. My understanding of the physical requirements is that they are to ensure a basic level of fitness, conditioning and strength. If you look at the standards chart, there are also divisions based on age. A 19 year old is held to different standards than a 26 year old man. 

There are a myriad of different positions in the military and not all of them require the same physical qualifications. Further, if true physical ability was being tested the fitness test would be much more complete as there are a wide variety of methods that can be used to determine physical fitness. It’s not just about running, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, etc. 

I don’t think this is about lowering standards, it’s about being honest about what the standards are actually testing. 

ERROR:
The poor have the least political power. Yes poor/middle/upper middle class people can vote, (yet the majority still does not) but IMO the system is rigged because of the huge amounts of money being pored in by millionaires/billionaires/companies. At the local level, we have more of a say then on the federal level because there's not (yet) massive amounts of money for campaigning at the local level. Politicians with the most money have a greater chance of winning. Here http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-election-money-2012-11 in 2012 95% of the 429 house races who won spent the most money. While 80% of winners who campaigned with the most money won in the senate. The politicians who run will get money from a majority of wealthy people/businesses and in turn the winning politicians will push for favors/lobby for the best interests of companies. For funding given directly to the politicians  60% of the total funds come from less then 0.1% of the population which gave $2300+, 0.5% of the population gave $250-2290 which accounted for 22% of overal founds in 2008. http://www.acrreform.org/research/money-in-politics-who-gives/. (Websites source was via Federal Election Commission, Center for Responsive Politics, Public Campaignʼs “The Color of Money” Project 

Then there's the superpacs who raise a lot of money. For the 2012 election superpacs raised 656 million The top 130 doners gave 60% of the money. Each of those doners gave at least $1million. Doners who gave more then $10000 made up 97.6% all superpacs. Only 1.6% of the money came from people who donated less then $5000. 61 doners gave an average of 4.7 million. 

So this says if you have the most money while campaigning at the federal level, you have a great chance of winning. And a small number of wealthy people who donate to the politicians and the superpacs male up a huge majority of the campaign money. 

http://www.demos.org/publication/election-spending-2012-post-election-analysis-federal-election-commission-data

I think it would be highly unfair to expect a kid who is in high school or straight out of high school to pay $3500 for taxes. Or the elderly who could not afford it after they have worked their whole lives and retired. Or all the people who cannot work because they are disabled etc. a basic component of taxes is that it is not separated evenly between everyone. Roads for example. You may not drive on a certain section but thousands of others might. I don't think a tax like you suppose is even equal as equal would be defined. A flat tax would be more equal then your system plus the government would probably get a lot more of our taxes which would make them happier as well. (Just stating it, not agreeing with it) looking at your post again, you say flat tax but I've never seen it used that way. It's always been used as a percentage according to income the way I've seen it. 

It sounds like your goal is to have our budget fixed or lowered. Speaking of fair, I think it would be fair that corporations should pay more taxes then they do now. Corporations only pay 1% of the total GDP compared to 27% six decades ago. Something like 1/3 of  companies don't pay taxes because of all the loopholes. http://www.ourfiscalsecurity.org/taxes-matter/tag/tax-loopholes
These loopholes stay there because the corporations helped pay for the campaign which helped win the election, and the reason they donate was to keep the loopholes in.  
I don't think we as poor, middle, or high middle class people really have any power or influence in politics at the federal level. IMO we need to get money out of politics. The cycle of buying off politicians to pass legislation for the people who paid the politicians is unfair, unethical and undermines our democracy. 

TL dr. 95% of over 420 winning politicians in the house were the ones who spent the most. 60% of direct funds were from the 0.1% of Americans, 0.5% Americans donated 22% of funds. Only 1.6% of money from superpacs came from people who donated less then $5000, 2.3% less then $10000. 130 people donated 60% of the 656 million. 61 gave an average of 4.7m, 2 people gave more then $50 million. A small amount of rich people basically set up who we will be voting for. For spending on the politicians, the politicians return the favor and keep loopholes in for the rich and for corporations who give jack in taxes because of loopholes. 
ERROR:
You set up a straw man to begin with, and you finish with one. You characterize logic by people who use it to dismiss rather than explain, thus characterizing logic using a very emotional argument such as "don't these logical people do awful things, shouldn't that be taken out on the importance or primacy of logic?"  
  
Well, no, it shouldn't. Just like anger shouldn't be taken out on the value of passion.  
  
So just to sum up an easy response to what you've said:  
All judgments people make involve emotions and logic. You can't avoid intellect, because it's entailed in planning, and you'll be using some kind of logic with your intellect whether it's well justified or not. Unless you suffer from a condition where you don't report passion or emotion, we can reason that emotion is present in everyuthinng you do as well. So all in all, they're both present.  
That moves on to your CMV being a response to people who claim logic should be more important than emotion, and how much logic should take the helm in whatever it is you're doing. I think that people who are claiming logic should take the lead and have a good argument aren't often the people from the straw man examples you gave of people championing logic. Those good arguments claim logic should take the lead in ways like the following:  

1. have a passion, then plan effectively so you have a better chance of success.  
2. Experience an emotion, then admit you're experiencing it and choose dispationately which is the best path to solve the situation rather than whatever your first idea was, because you admitted you experienced the emotion and you can admit that first idea might not be well thought out.  
3. Engage your emotions and don't ignore them in any way, and ensure you don't spend too much time thinking over a plan before you execute it, but rather spend as much time as it takes to make sure your plan should work and isn't emotionally derived or based on slim chances from narrow emotion led perspectives.  
4. Understand your emotional needs, such as what you are looking for out of a social life. Be sure not to stay in relationships out of an emotional need, but also because you can logically justify that the relationship is healthy for you and them. Obviously emotion alone would designate a social life or not, but the logic would define how often, deeply, and publicly you engage them in conversation, and how specifically you do that.  
  

I don't see anything wrong with "logic primacy" as described in those examples.
ERROR:
My first intuition is this. Franklin, et al, accept the court sanctioned suffering of the guilty and not that of the innocent because when it happens to the guilty it is punishment. Punishment is by its nature retributive so when we, as a society, make it a policy to only harm the guilty we can say we are justly punishing. If our policy about when to harm our own citizens is something less strong than “no reasonable doubt” we will have to admit that we are not, in fact, punishing--we are adopting a policy that reads something like: We may harm the innocent if doing so will result in less aggregate suffering. 

At this point, many familiar criticisms apply. For example, consider the perfectly healthy man who is at the doctor’s office getting a check up. This doctors also happens to be treating a patents who needs new lungs and two who need new kidneys. These patients are on the verge of death. They have only hours to live if they don’t all find compatible donors and, as (bad?) luck would have it, the perfectly healthy man is a match for all of them. 

Now, it seems to me that the doctor may not, without the man’s permission, kill the man and harvest his organs for transplant--even though doing so would result in a net gain of two lives. Although there are obvious disanalogies between that case and this one, it seems that the moral of the doctor story must apply here as well: certain rights supersede utilitarian calculation.

Furthermore, even if we reject this line of reasoning and stick with the utilitarian one, it’s not clear that there will actually be less suffering if the lower the “reasonable doubt” standard and so we may have reason to like it where it is. Let’s say ten serial beater-upers and let free and they each beat up one person a week for a year until they’re caught and convicted. That’s 520 people beaten up that year and, granted, that is (particular) suffering that could have been avoided by lowering the standard. But consider the world where this standard is lower, and the innocent are harmed. That’s millions and millions of people, every citizen, living with that sword of damocles over their heads. Surely, the excess suffering any one of them is caused by this is nothing compared to one of the 520 who were beaten up, but we talking about 520 against millions and millions. 

So how do we decide? 520 in a lot of pain or millions and millions in some psychological discomfort: which one “adds up” to more? Absent the relevant calculus it seems to me that the answer must be: it’s not clear. And if it’s not clear that lower the standard reduces suffering then it’s not clear that utilitarianism prescribes its being lowered.

Let me pre-apologize for an non sequiturs in there. It’s 2am and I’m too drunk to proofread. 

Thanks for the interesting topic, OP.
ERROR:
Like /u/ZippityZoppity said, it really is about the people you're around. Find the wrong groups, the wrong places, etc, and you'll find yourself around a lot of uncaring people instead of just half or a few.  
  
Beyond that, you've got to get to know people before they'll act invested, and that's fairly normal. It doesn't take long to honestly care and try to befriend someone before you can reasonably expect the kind of exchange you're saying should be normal. Depending on the person again, maybe 1/3 will act selfish no matter how close you get and some 1/5 will be friendly with you but it will take years.  
  
The easiest way I can think of to change your view though, is that there really are a lot of people who do not want something selfish out of company with you. Sure, sometimes it comes down to defending yourself (if only in a "I have things to do so I can't help this time, sorry" kind of situation), but most often it just comes down to the quality of the encounter you have vs the idea of quality encounters the person you're interacting with thinks about and sticks to.  
Some people, I'd say at least a 1/3 in the world you will meet, will not try to take advantage of you unless you open yourself to it clearly (which doesn't always mean consent, they may take advantage of you even if they think you don't realize what you're giving up, simply because you offered clearly). I would speculate that most of that 1/3 are people who have wide ranging interests in the world, or who are still too young to want much else out of friendships than friendships and haven't settled into their favorite adult roles yet.  
  
So if I think I can change your view, it's only because you can atleast find one selfless person in your life who will reject involving you in any agenda the takes unnecessarily from you and probably involves some kind of love or friendship (hopefully your significant other if not someone else too), and at least 1/3 you meet won't try to take advantage unless you offer. That is definitely different than thinking everyone engages for their agenda, or doesn't care about others, or don't care if they're annoying or destructive, or don't care about emotionally healthy interactions or relationships, etc (those are just some of the conclusions I think you'd have to derive from your view to keep it, and I don't think they can be true for everyone).  
  
You'll also have to consider that depending on how people see you live your life, handle your responsibilities, handle authority in your career or your relationships, that it doesn't matter how well you do at getting close to them. There are people who will see *you* as the bad person and won't care about taking advantage of you. Ethics is a complex topic once you start looking at how a person has acted in every scenario throughout their entire life, and who they see you as will impact things.  
  
So is everyone out to serve their own agenda and don't often act in the interest of others? Maybe 2/3s of them regularly, 1/4 less regularly, 1/10 quite often, and another 1/5 you should have an easy go of it with regarding healthy relationships that don't involve a lot of taking. It is common knowledge you have to search for the good ones, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.
ERROR:
After reading many of your responses, it looks like your title and your actual view are separate. Your title: engaging in certain activities implies one isn't strong enough to handle life. Your actual view as a tautology: people who engage in certain activities enough to be classified as having an addiction have an addiction, and having an addiction implies you aren't strong enough to handle many things you come across.  
  
If I am correct, and please tell me if I am, then your view is trivially true. Akin to saying 2=2.  
  
That said, people who have addictions commonly handle many things in life, so it would still be more accurate for you to change your view to "some people who have addictions will fail handling at least one of the difficulties of life." Where that one difficulty may simply be escaping their addiction, rather than the addiction heavily impacting another area of their life.
ERROR:
I'm assuming you're agreeing to the first part of what I'm saying, that your view is "addictions are addictions."  
  
What about the end, where I am attempting to change your view by pointing out that addictions only "may" include failing at at least one difficulty of life?
ERROR:
Assuming that we all agree on what behavior is moral and what behavior is immoral -  
  
What about immoral behavior that a religious person defends because it is in accordance with their religious beliefs?  Atheists don't have a common belief structure that can be used to defend any behaviors, moral or otherwise.  So lumping them together based on behavior patterns seems pretty arbitrary to me.  But depending on which religion one subscribes to, the followers of that religion often behave in very similar and predictable ways and sometimes that behavior is deemed as moral and sometimes (I might assert often times) that behavior is widely seen as immoral by others outside of that religion.

I googled “cable news ratings” and found that Fox News overwhelmingly leads in ratings. I am a conservative, so I am biased, but I really find this interesting. Could it be that since there are like 5 “liberal” networks vs. one conservative network that the ratings spread is unequal? Or is it that conservatives watch the news more than liberals? 

It is clear to me that there are informed voters and uninformed voters. I have nothing against an informed liberal voter. I know many, and they study the issues, and feel the way they feel, and vote accordingly. That is democracy. What peeves me is that there are so many that vote that have no clue as to what the issues are, and don’t even have an opinion when asked. They just vote based on…I don’t even know…whoever is most popular at the time. Whoever their social circle tells them to vote for. That is screwing up our Country I believe. 

I have a gal friend at work who in 2012 was asking me what the difference between liberals and conservatives was. I did NOT take the advantage to bash liberals. I simply sent her to a website that explained the differences of opinion on the major issues between liberals and conservatives. I explained that most people weren’t loyal to all the views of one particular party, but usually shared some views from each party. 

She was stunned that most of her views were conservative. I was stunned when she said she would vote democrat anyway because that’s what her family and friends were doing. Case in point. 

What do the ratings really say? I think that the informed prefer Fox and the uniformed prefer ignorance. I am really open minded, and willing to change my view. So…change it. 

**EDIT:** Here's what I'm getting out of this. In the words of Mark Twain: If you don't read the news, you are uninformed. If you do read the news, you are misinformed.

I think that your statement is self-defeating. When you say "I believe you should never hold a belief so firm that your mind cannot be changed", this itself would entail an absolute belief that you couldn't change your mind about. Because if you changed your mind, then you would no longer believe that all beliefs should be open to change. So either way, whether you affirm this belief or deny it, you're allowing that (at least) one belief needs to be held so firm that your mind cannot be changed. Its a self-defeating, somewhat similar to this one: "All sentences are false."   
    
The most you could say is that "I believe you should never hold a belief so firm that your mind cannot be changed, *except for the belief I am articulating right now*".

The Olympics is a celebration of the absolute pinnacle of human physical achievement. I love watching them. But as the bar keeps getting raised, so do the demands placed on these athletes.      
      

Early twenties is seen as the prime for many events. Teenagers for others such as gymnastics. This forces training to begin early. Age 4. It is no wonder that a large majority of Olympians have parents who were Olympians themselves.
       
At age 4 the only thing I was passionate about was Power Rangers. The years of rigorous training these kids must do to perform at the elite level **deprives** them of a normal childhood. We deride the mother of Honey Boo Boo, and the parents of trophy kids. I believe there is a false dichotomy between this and the Olympian mentality. CMV.

With the creation of MySpace in 2003 and Facebook in 2004, the computer-savvy American population began to change how they communicated, whom they communicated with and, most importantly, how they appeared to others. What was once created for University students only has now spread to older generations, down to high school, middle school, and now even some elementary schools. Children are, from a young age, interacting with technology and social media where the ideals reinforced largely surround appearance and popularity. Maintaining a social media page (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, etc) focuses on how many friends or followers one may have, which type of pictures they allow on their profiles, which pictures and filters they will publish to give off a certain impression to others, and more. It is frightening to think how important a role image will play in the upbringing of generation Z …"style" has become something expected of 10- and 11-year-olds, and sexuality is being experimented with at a much earlier age with the rise of sexting and selfies. 
While I do believe that the new generation of social media has allowed us to expand our networks and connect with individuals that we would otherwise not have access to, I think that in many facets our appearance has become of utmost importance. Even recruiters now look at our LinkedIn profiles or Facebook pages to see if we are an eligible candidate for a job, and parents have a new way to monitor and spy on their children's social lives via their pictures and pages.
While I engage in social media and appreciate it's networking potential with colleagues, classmates, friends, family and future employers, I do believe that it has made my generation (Y) and the current generation (Z) more vain and focused on appearance.

This is a quandary of logic that I discovered a while back. Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a “spreading of the gospel”, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. 

This is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either “They get a free pass” or “They never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.” 

This leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view “the truth”, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?

TL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about. CMV

I had a heated ideological debate last night with 2 sociologists and a feminist over the definition of 'racism'. 
 
The way I understand it, racism is simply race-based discrimination. If you make a statement that generalizes all members of a certain race or singles them out in a negative way, you're being racist regardless of which race you make the statement about. 
 
The way they argued it is that racism is no longer racism if it's directed at the racial group in power aka white people. This is a paradox. They are discriminating against a specific race to redefine the term, 'racism', manifesting the new term, 'reverse racism', to address racial discrimination against white people. By doing this, they reinscribe the very meaning of racism that I claim to be true as they are discriminating against a group of people based on their race. 
 
Help me wrap my head around how sociologists think they can redefine a term by employing that term.

Basically, I feel that of all areas to which someone can dedicate themselves--art, science, politics, etc.--fashion is by far the least worthwhile. 
     
   My reasoning is this: science is clearly not it. Whether or not a technology or scientific advancement actually helps people, it is at least usually the goal that it would do so. Same with politics: politicians and people interested in politics, at least ostensibly, do what they do in order to improve the world. 
     
   So then you're left with art and similar creative fields. Visual arts and music don't always seek to benefit people in a practical way, or at all; but I feel that both art and music tend to have a lasting impact culturally. Music from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries is still played and enjoyed today. Composers like Mozart and Ellington are still relevant and known. Same with artists like Picasso and Da Vinci. I don't see that same trend in fashion, at least aside from people who actually follow and take fashion seriously. The average individual doesn't know anything about great fashion designers or great works of fashion (if that's even a thing--I don't know) from history. 
   
   Do note: I'm not talking about clothes in general. I know that what we wear has in many ways improved over the years, in cost, efficiency, thermal insulation, etc. I'm not talking about people who dedicate themselves to designing a better ski jacket or giving shoes to poor Africans. When I say "fashion", I am specifically referring to the runway models, the designers, the photographers, and the industry they represent. 

 Edit: Well, I was not expecting so many responses! I wish I could reply to all of them, but I just don't have the time, and at any rate there are a lot of similar responses here, so it makes more sense to address them all at once. First of all, I realize now that my wording was pretty bad as far as what I was actually trying to say; I shouldn't have included "beneficial" in there at all, as that's not really what I was getting at. Second of all, many have talked about how fashion is simply "wearable art"; a valid point. In my mind fashion and art had always been separate, probably because I've been to a few art museums and zero fashion museums (I don't doubt they exist).  Another point that was made was the matter of separating fashion into "high fashion" and just plain clothes--in hindsight that kind of opens up a world of responses as far as things that are worse or more meaningless or what have you. 

   Thank you all, you've been very helpful. Consider my view changed!

Not every dealer is buying from a cartel down the line. Not most either.  
  
The recreational user and the dealer are often one and the same, and before decriminalization were both engaged in illegal things, so separating the two and saying the latter just happens to still be breaking the law by decision isn't a meaningful distinction.  
  
Do you have any other reason people charged with intent to distribute should remain in jail other than a flimsy link to cartels (which can entirely change along with the right to grow in the country)?

I won't bore you with my life story but I'll give you a good idea of how I developed this thinking.  
  
When I was 26 years old I was a college dropout (but high-school grad) and had no skills whatsoever, so I moved from job to job a lot. I found myself hating my life at 26 with no future or prospects, so basically every day I'd go to work, then I'd come home and play video games (they are what helped me get away from the reality of life). On the weekends (if I wasn't working or staying indoors gaming), I'd go out with friends.   
  
A friend of mine in Seattle was posting some nice pictures of his apt./car on facebook, I basically started talking to him and we got to talking about jobs, I basically said "I wish I could do what you do man", to which he said "well you can learn", and he basically talked to me about how he programmed and that most companies didn't require a degree, but skill.    
   
**Long story short**, I would wake up an hour early every morning learning to program and whenever I came home, would spend all my time learning some more (instead of gaming). I'd go out about once a month on the weekend as opposed to **every** weekend. Nine months later I quit my job and got an entry level programing job where my salary wasn't too bad (still much better than stocking shelves). It's been about 6 years since I made that decision and I've finally broken six figures (though I admit it's only that high because it's a major metropolis). However anywhere else in the country I'd be making at least 80k. 
   
The point I'm trying to make is I really think that people who complain are not necessarily lazy, but have no initiative. They'd rather facebook or game or watch pointless videos than learn a skill in demand.

You don't seem to understand my argument. One of my premises is that laws do not, in fact, force you to choose. Laws provide an incentive for you to choose one type of behavior over another, but as I said, they do not govern your actual ability to make a choice. You can choose to perform any action you can otherwise perform. You say that I am "directly coerced into not making that choice", which is simply untrue. If we're talking dictionary definitions, then [coercion](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coerce) is to compel someone to do something by force or threat... but a law can fail to coerce me. The law can *try* to coerce me, but it cannot *make* me do anything. It can only, as I wrote in the above post, administer consequences for my actions. You are misusing the word ‘coercion’. In one of your above posts, you wrote “If it was illegal to drive on St Patrick's day, I would be coerced into not driving through no choice of my own”. Well, no, that’s false.  You would still be making a choice to obey or disobey the law. Coercion depends on the subject’s willingness to be coerced—this is why drunk driving exists today (or, by extension, why anyone breaks any law). Drunk people aren’t making a rational choice to drive drunk, because the decision-making processes that govern rational behavior have been disabled! The coercion that you seem to think is so powerful does nothing to prevent them from drunken driving. 

You wrote "If driving was illegal, would you say that you are equally as free to make the choice to drive as not?" and the answer is, if you have a car, yes! You're free, by your definition of freedom--and I'm going by this explicitly stated line in your above post, "It is not WHAT YOU CHOOSE but YOUR ABILITY to choose which defines freedom"--to choose to drive in that scenario, and get pulled over for it. Your entire premise about risk is that knowing the potential consequences of an action doesn’t prevent you from taking said action. I don’t see how you can reasonably hold the belief that the law is different. 

/u/DerekReinbold and /u/gpunotpsu seem to be handling the issue of the definition of freedom quite well, so I won't get into it too much. However, OP, answer me this: is it possible to decrease the freedom of another person by your own actions?

 Also, I’d like to call you out on a couple of things, OP. 

&gt;You state that your "internal" motivations count as coercion.

&gt;You made the gun analogy

I understand that you’re replying to a lot of comments at once, OP, but I did not say those things. You’ll want to keep an eye on that.

This new and increasingly trite fad of listing rules for dealing with supposed introverts is pointless and not doing any good.  Introvert advocates think they're making a novel point about a problem unique to them, when in reality *everyone* confronts social anxiety to one degree or another.  I'm pretty sure this introvert revolution started with [Quiet](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/) by Susan Cain—quite good I'm told—but has devolved into buzzfeed lists of [things only introverts will understand](http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/problems-only-introverts-will-understand).

Here is a summary of my reasons for believing that "introverts" are not an actual class of people, and don't deserve special treatment:

* **The dichotomy is false**.  Practically no one is all the way an introvert or all the way an extrovert.  I'm one of the most extroverted, outgoing people that I know and guess what?  Sometimes I just want a little "me time."  By dividing and categorizing people this way we're just individualizing a set of problems that are really universal to the human experience.

* **The label authorizes laziness**.  Imagine this: it's 9:30pm on a Friday night.  You're not planning on going out.  Suddenly your phone buzzes, and it's your friend—s/he's planning to drive over an hour to some huge mega party, and wants you to come.  How do you feel about that?  I think most of us would feel a little apprehensive about it, and maybe even search for some excuse not to go.  Dare I say, most of us *wouldn't* go.  But some portion of us suck it up and lace our boots, and go out into the world to have great experiences. Not because we are wild and carefree and meld effortlessly into any social situation, but because we know that waiting for experience to come knocking down your door is the same as waiting for death.  We go *in spite* of our inclination to just stay in and browse reddit because life is outdoors.  Because the the world begins where your comfort zone ends.  Because there's 7 billion beautiful, disgusting, needy, incomprehensible, brilliant, frustrating people out there waiting to be met.  In the words of Dave Eggers:

&gt;*"No" is for wimps. "No" is for pussies. "No" is to live small and embittered, cherishing the opportunities you missed because they might have sent the wrong message.... It is a fuckload of work to be open-minded and generous and understanding and forgiving and accepting, but Christ, that is what matters. What matters is saying yes.*

* **The term is meaningless**.  No one can seem to agree just what an introvert even is.  Seriously look at that buzzfeed article I linked above.  Is there a single list item that you can't relate to?  It's just become such a dilute, catch-all expression that basically anyone who has any emotions at all can grab onto it.  And any time you do try to put a definition on it, there's a chorus of voices correcting supposed "myths" about introverts ([introverts are not shy, introverts love to talk](http://www.carlkingdom.com/10-myths-about-introverts#.UtdRZmST540), etc).

* **The term pointlessly shifts the burden in social situations onto "extroverts"**.  You're made uncomfortable by talking? Well I'm made uncomfortable by silence.  (I'm not actually, it's just an example).  I guess I'm automatically a bad guy because I have a different social appetite than you.

I would honestly like if this view changed, because it does kind of make me seem like a jerk, I realize.  So someone please CMV!

*Edit:* Something that's getting a weird amount of attention is my reference to buzzfeed.  I'm kind of surprised I have to point this out, but this post is principally concerned with *people who identify as introverts* not the academic, clinically accurate definition of introversion.  And people who identify as introverts are largely relying on shallow, low quality, content mill type sources to bemoan their plight.  If the buzzfeed version of introversion—which by the way has a million likes, 180k shares, and 5.5 million views—differs significantly for a more clinical, measured definition, if anything that bolsters my view. There's some number of people who are exceptionally introverted by a rigorous standard? Fine. They're the 10 percent.

•Has a relatively high minimum number of people to play (arguably 6)

Sure, but you need that many for baseball as well.  Basketball can be 1 on 1, but is generally played with more.  Soccer and hockey have similar restrictions.

•Requires a large amount of space to play

The field is no bigger than any other sport on grass.  

•Relatively confusing rules

True, although you could probably follow along more easily than baseball. 

•(last I checked) Most expensive average ticket cost

That's a result of popularity.  That's just a matter of supply and demand.  Needless to say, there's a lot of demand for football tickets. 

•Shortest season length of the four major North American sports

True.

•Really large amounts of dead time

True, but baseball is only [18 minutes](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323740804578597932341903720) of live time.  Also, tennis would be a great place for jamming in commercials if you wanted, with potential breaks after each game. 

&gt;So why did American sports fans settle on football as the sport to watch? I believe it is because broadcasters realized that football's design flaws made it well suited to a format with a high density of commercial advertisements

Then how do you explain football's popularity before TV became a major aspect of professional sports?  Back before TV, football had quite a following, particularly at the college level.  In fact, by 1909, the idea of attracting alumni with homecoming football games became a thing. 

Regardless, your contention lacks a critical piece of evidence.  You've demonstrated that football is popular and has lots of dead time.  However, you haven't presented any evidence of cause and effect.  You need to show evidence that the popularity is because of this aspect of the game.

I don't want to attack your argument from the any other angle other than try to convince you that your conclusion to dismiss the experiences of others entirely is equally--if not more so--baffling to attributing it to cyborgs or brains in a vat.  
  
First of all, just because you can't comprehend how something can be so doesn't mean that isn't. It seems like a pretty silly view to me to say "welp, I can't imagine that being true because it blows my mind" and reaching an equally radical conclusion for it. Do you have any good reasons for holding deep disbelief? After all, there's times when you have very good reasons for dismissing certain thoughts or ideas but I see no argument on your part why other than your own inability to comprehend it. That's an argument from ignorance and not very sound.  
  
Next up, what makes you think that everyone being a cyborg is any more comprehensible? How did those cyborgs come to be here? How did they come to mimic your thoughts and experiences so well that you could almost be fooled for their authenticity? How is that any easier to grasp?  
  
Or that there's a computer out there that, when you go to the beach, simulates each and every grain of sand you feel on your fingers, simulates the way the sun and water feels so consistently you're never suspicious that anything is awry. Just imagine the amount of power necessary to run it. How is that any more likely than hey, you're actually not part of a computer simulation and there's other minds around you also experiencing this world?  
  
Or if you're the only mind to have ever existed and everyone else is just a projection. Where in the hell did you get the ideas for the shape of physical matters? Or of humans? How did that influence you? Are you truly just capable of coming up with new shapes and models at that high of a capacity? Why is it more likely that you have these incredible mental powers that have for all your life remained suspiciously absent rather than other people being as "real" as you are?
  
It just seems to me that you got overwhelmed and were too quick to just go to the other extreme without stopping to asses what your conclusions imply.

We’ve all heard that term before. Eugenics. It’s been morally debated left and right, 
and I’d simply like to make it clear, before we begin. I am not advocating in any way 
for reducing the reproductive abilities of certain parts of the population, through means 
of forced abortion, sterilization, or any of those other terms that come to mind when 
one thinks of “eugenics”.

Rather, I believe that with the current rate at which technology grows, we as a society 
come across larger and larger issues. Pollution. Global warming. Hunger. Overpopulation. 
War. And a million other things that, I’m sure, everyone can agree will have to be tackled 
in the future by those bright young citizens, who today are flailing around with milk bottles 
and pacifiers.

My argument, thus, is that the US government should work to increase the general 
intelligence of society as a whole, in order to benefit mankind in the future. While 
there are many before me who have argued for or against eugenics, debating the morality 
of such a move, I believe that we can achieve this goal without infringing upon the rights 
that all US citizens have.

How? By incentivizing people above a certain intelligence threshold to get married, in the 
hopes that they will procreate, and produce “desirable” offspring. A monetary bonus, or maybe 
a lower income tax? For the majority of Americans who do not meet the threshold, life goes on 
as normal. The government doesn’t try to interfere with what they do. 

I know, I know. IQ tests aren’t reliable! It’s true, but at the moment, they’re all we have. 
Certainly, as time progresses, they will get more and more accurate, but it seems to be 
common knowledge those with high or genius-level IQ scores are, generally, smarter than 
the rest of the population. 

These tests would, of course, be completely optional to take, free, and made available 
wherever possible, to ward off any charges of discrimination. Those who pass the test, who 
marry others who also have passed the test, would be granted the aforementioned incentive. 
The threshold itself is a subject of debate, and one that I really don’t wish to focus on in this 
CMV. I will only say that there is some line between “normal” and “smart”, and leave it to the 
scientists to figure out where that line is. Nothing is perfect, but that doesn’t mean that we 
shouldn’t try.

It seems, however, that I’m alone in the viewpoint that such a move is more beneficial 
than harmful to society. People who I’ve pitched this idea to seem to be against it, and for 
the life of me, I cannot understand why. I understand that it's morally gray. But I truly believe
that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks. So please, Reddit. CMV.

While I agree with some of your overall criticisms of the flaws in the present system, my underlying objection varies in foundation and as such I can only offer to extrapolate on that delineation rather than fight for/against the majority of your proposal.    
             
What compelled me to reply, however, was this statement:    
                                
Within the context of expected reason (it is unreasonable to request all people be all happy all the time, and as such the request is not eligible to be considered rational or taken seriously- however, a normal and expected amount of unhappiness as part of a normal life can co-exist with the ideal of maximizing cultural happiness and health and that is a rational request)-    
                
&gt; Yeah, great, everyone should have all their basic needs met, everyone should be fed and healthy and happy. But not everyone can be, because there is no working way fathomable to get there and sustain it.         
                 
This is blatantly and patently untrue and promoting the notion that such concepts and societal structures are impossibilities is misguided at best.     
             
Perhaps a middle ground might be met by clarifying the divide between *ideals* and *realities*, which is what I believe you may be trying to elucidate- that proposing ideals can be treated no different than realities is an unworkable strategy.

The American public school system is terrible at what, teaching students how to pass standardized tests? But our universities consistently produce the best graduates! How can that be?We test *everyone* on *everything* at the same level. Other countries track their students, such that if you test middle-of-the-road at a young age you won't likely be given much chance to advance, and then test accordingly. They don't expect students with learning disabilities to test at the same level as "gifted" students, while we do.Granted, there is a lot that can and needs to be improved on in public education system. But we do a very good job at getting students into college, and weeding out students whom a traditional education wouldn't benefit. The proof is in the pudding.

Kudos on being open-minded enough to consider the alternatives and your fiancé's wishes; and congratulations on your upcoming marriage!

There are some practical advantages to changing names. In my experience (my spouse did not take my last name), this has led to confusion with respect to our child when doctors, teachers, etc. don't recognize both of us as being parents. Also, it's always a hassle when picking up medicine for her at the pharmacy, since my ID doesn't match her name. Also, she is continually referred to as "Mrs. So and So" even though it's not her name, something which annoys her. Finally, socially, it's still more common in the U.S. for one spouse to take the other's last name; outdated or not, you do break the social norms by not doing it. 

Taking the other's name signifies a transition in life, a formal attachment and commitment to the marriage which can be a good thing. Sometimes, symbols do matter. And sometimes we just do things for the people we love even if we may disagree with them.

The 'real world consequences' you list as the result of 'hands on learning' lack any real or valid proof as being the *result* of the methodology you criticize, and it is extremely simple to show that the connection you imply is a false and unfounded one.    
         
How can we show this? Easy.

There is no scientific 'controversy' over evolution in my country- the entire idea that this could warrant public attention is laughable. Denial of evolution is on par with believing the earth is flat and there is no discussion whatsoever of it being taught in any way in public schools.  
            
Vaccine deniers exist, and are regarded as a miniscule demographic barely worthy of media coverage- right along side that insane vegan couple that pops up somewhere once a year that kills their baby by feeding them only alfalfa sprouts and tofu water.    
         
What is considered 'alternative' medicine here, isn't the same subject in the USA. Did I assume wrong about your location? If so, I apologize.    
            
The 'hands on' methodology was prevalent during my school years and still is, and is widely lauded as *increasing* interest and understanding in science, and has no connection to the social and cultural issues you are focusing on, which are not found here, or in countless other first world nations that use similar educational methods.

I hope this doesn't come across as too offensive, but your position is one of ignorance and naïveté, and it does nothing to help those who need it.

Others have addressed the pain and suffering those who commit suicide often experience, but I shall emphasize some of what they've said. Many people do not have, or cannot get, access to help. Their families and friends often aren't supportive, especially not in the way they need to be. Most people are unable to relate to the depressed, so they ask, 'Why don't you just feel happy today?' This is no more logical or productive than asking why someone with cancer doesn't just wish it away. 'Treatment' is not guaranteed even with those who have access to the best services and most supportive families. Psychological therapy techniques are imperfect, and even mild results can take months to show themselves. Medication for depression isn't like painkillers - you don't pop a pill and then within an hour you're feeling much better. Trying one pill can take months to see if there are any results. Most people have to try multiple medications to achieve even some relief - so we're talking on a scale of years. These medications often have rather nasty and common side-effects, and their effects aren't well understood. Many people try various medications and only get worse. And, through all of these, the suffering of depression remains. Happiness is no longer a goal - the person just wants the pain, the guilt and the numbness to go away. 

The comparison to jumping out of a burning building are suitable. I have been suicidal in the past, and though I wanted to exist in a state of pure nothingness - to be *dead,* I did not want to go through the process of *dying.* Contrary to your perception, committing suicide requires *bravery.*

There's another important point of this, and this is something I don't believe anyone's brought up yet. Committing suicide is often a *selfless* act, and I mean that in the truest sense of the word. Many depressed people commit suicide not because of the despair and anguish they feel, but because they are being a burden on others. They see themselves as not having worth, and that certainly means not worth the time and resources others put into them. So why not commit suicide since it would help them? This is a belief they may very well hold despite being explicitly told, numerously, otherwise. Remember that depression is not rational.

And even if that's not the case, I would still argue that suicide is not a selfish act - not in the negative connotation you have framed it in. Why should someone be subject to years of mental torture just so others can feel fine? Suicide should always be about the person who is suffering - it's prevention should be because it may be possible for them to go on to live a happier life. And, if it's demonstrated that they can't, suicide should be an option for them.

There's some critical flaws in your reasoning: First, while diets may have a very high acute success rate, but they have a very low long-term success rate -- only 2% of people who diet keep the weight off for 2 years. (Stunkard AJ, McLaren-Hume M. The results of treatment for obesity. Arch Int Med 1959;103:79–85.)

Further damaging your hypothesis, is the fact that [there is evidence of a substantial genetic-only component to the heritability of obesity](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/2/398.abstract?ijkey=936f5ba3a0d74739e679c47122581d9d6fc397d3&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). In other words, the fundamental stuff that makes up a person has a large effect on whether they are obese or not.

The problem isn't just an issue of metabolism, it's a much more difficult issue of the subconscious regulation of food intake.

It's difficult to wrap someone's head around how you could acutely control your weight but not be able to do so long term, so I'm going to use another subconsciously regulated system to demonstrate the problem.

Many athletes believe that training in a [reduced oxygen environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training) will make a person better suited to being an athlete by forcing the body to adapt to not having as much oxygen. Now, we all know that people are fully capable of breathing in and breathing out at will. Given these facts, why do they need to head to a reduced oxygen environment, when they should be able to just breathe less oxygen? Surely all they need to do is breathe less, no matter what excuses are made up by themselves or even offered to them by society?

In terms of food intake in an environment of virtually unlimited food, or air intake in an environment of virtually unlimited oxygen, they can both be consciously affected, but there are also subconscious drivers at work: Your brain actively works to regulate the amount of oxygen in your body and tries to force you to breathe that amount. Likewise, your brain actively works to regulate the amount of food you take in and tries to force you to eat that amount. In both cases it's fully possible to consciously regulate that value for a short time, but over time your body will try to make up for the problem.

Essentially you’re arguing something so obvious as to be nearing tautology, i.e. “Poor people would be better off if they didn’t do things that poor people do.”

To address your concern about idolizing the wrong people, that’s a relative problem and you’re probably guilty of it in your own way. By your own standard of success you’re developing bad habits by not aspiring to be Warren Buffet. People choose idols that seem within their grasp, goals that seem realistic and achievable.

TL;DR — If you think that poor people feel empowered to be anything and choose drug dealers as idols because that's truly the furthest their imaginations will carry them, you’re mistaken.

First of all, thank you for being a rational and compassionate human being. Far too many times I see a topic relating to cyclists brought up, and the majority opinion—even on usually left-wing Reddit—is that cyclists are a waste of space and cars shouldn't have to deal with cyclists on the road. It's an entirely selfish and arrogant viewpoint. I completely agree with you, so my argument is tentatively devil's advocate, although not entirely.

My argument is that bike lanes are only marginally safer than not having them, since many drivers tend to ignore them if they're concentrating on other things like changing lanes or turning. Instead, a better option is proper bike paths that are completely separated from the road. As long as pedestrians are aware of them, it's much safer than having cyclists ride on the road, regardless of whether or not there is a bike lane. Now, it isn't feasible in all cases, and it's a lot more expensive, but in cases where it is feasible it's much safer.

For context: I am Canadian.  
  
I'll break this position down into sections from narrow to broad.
  
1. I don't believe that war is ever justifiable for me, personally.  Meaning I would never go to war for my country or to the aid of another country.  The personal cost to my psyche of taking another human life outweighs any ideal of nationalism, defence, or 'aid'.

2. I don't believe that war can be justified in our present global context.  Meaning that any current war or war that might be started in the future is not justifiable.    
I feel that current conflicts are fueled  by constant chest-puffing by countries demonstrating their military fortitude.  Just as the US feels threatened by a country like Iran with a differing national ideology building up a nuclear arsenal, Iran feels threatened by the US's already massive nuclear arsenal.  
Border/Land conflicts where both countries have a legitimate claim should be negotiated to a compromise.  Any attempt to claim/annex new land should be responded to with sanctions and cutting off trade etc.
Any civil conflict where a people uprises against an oppressive ruling power should be non-violent.  Violence perpetrated against the peaceful revolutionaries can/should/will be shown to the world (technological connectedness) and other countries should again respond by cutting off ties, and neighbouring countries taking in refugees.  
In a situation where a country is attacked by the forces of another country, I don't believe that a retaliatory war is justifiable.  Again, cutting ties to the country is the appropriate response.  
A country that shows aggression will not be able to show prolonged aggression if they are shut out of global trade - resources will run dry.

3. I don't believe that any war has ever been justifiable.  I am not a huge history buff, but I truly believe that no war has ever been necessary.

So, to summarize:  
I believe that peaceful solutions are present in any conflict and the choice to go to war is never justifiable.  
Point 3. is most likely to change, then point 2., and point 1. is most likely to remain as it is.  That said, feel free to challenge any or all of my views, and liberally cite any bygone battles, current conflicts, or future fallouts that may support your points!

Crack as a drug gives a euphoric high, and feelings of power or that you can do anything.

I would absolutely love to be president one day (no seriously… I would really like to and am lining my future up to attempt public office in the next five years). 

It’s not about the salary, the thanks, the accolades or the historical legacy. It’s about the country. 

I am a patriot, but I think America needs some serious work to be able to consider itself among the greatest countries on Earth again. Sure we are wealthy (in as much that the majority of our people do earn a living wage), but when did “great” turn out to mean “85% of people are above the poverty line, and we’ve still got nukes”? I think a great country needs to be measured by so much more than that, and that’s the impact I’d like to have. 

I think a great country needs to prioritize education so that the generations we are raising have the most potential for success than anyone who has ever preceded them, and I think the infrastructure needs to support this. I think that a great country truly gives the power to the people, and that state’s rights and responsibilities should be of paramount importance. I think a great country is innovative and proactive, rather than operating under the “this is how we’ve always done it” line (I’m looking at you, *War on Drugs*)

People who are driven to the prestige, gratitude and fame of public office are doing it for the wrong reasons.

First we have to look at the definition of natural:   
1**nat·u·ral** adjective \ˈna-chə-rəl, ˈnach-rəl\
: existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature

Based on *this* definition, it is safe to say that homosexuality is found in nature, thus, not caused by mankind and is therefore... natural.   
If you are trying to give an uprising to the origin of homosexuality, that would be determined at puberty, as is where all other sexualities are determined. You are also assuming that it is in our genes to want to reproduce. Although sex is pleasurable, our efforts to use contraceptives is a much greater concern. If contraceptives are widely accepted, why should any sexuality be shunned in any way, shape, or form?

I have never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, as a personal choice. However, I do not see the need of it in society. It makes people either belligerent, angry, and violent, or turns them into depressed, suicidal people. It is seen as such a normal thing that some people are only friends because the only thing they have in common IS the alcohol. And don't get me started on the amount of drunk driving that is done, and the fatalities that could've been VERY easily avoided. 
 
I think setting a maximum on the amount of liquor that can be sold by a town or a county would be a good thing, as it would force people to find other things in common. It would turn frat boys into more tolerable assholes. It might even decrease the amount of domestic violence in America. I'm not saying it would, and I understand it's not really an argument, but I like to be optimistic. 

I have had really good friends of mine have their lives absolutely ruined by alcohol, and drunk driving actually killed one of my best friends. I know people say alcohol is a social activity, but all it seems to lead to is unplanned pregnancies, fits of rage, and attempted suicide. It has destroyed countless lives. 

I think we were right to put Prohibition in place, I just think we went about it the wrong way. We'd have to wean people off of alcohol first, give them an alternative if they're trying to dull pain or make things more "interesting". There are other things for that, i'm sure, that are FAR less destructive and life-ruining.

I am open to changing my view. In fact, I WANT to be wrong. I want to be able to say it's no big deal, and everyone does it, but that sounds too much like peer pressure, and I don't put up with it. 

Someone, give me sources, links and information as to why this isn't as big a deal as I make it out to be. Tell me how I feel is wrong. I'm tired of people asking me WHY I don't drink, because then I just sound like an asshole. 

Thank you for your time, and I hope you guys can flip this around for me. I've held this belief since I was old enough to know what alcohol was, so it might be hard to change. 

Have a great night!

I'm not required to justify everything I say/think to a friend.  When I am in a formal setting I conduct myself to avoid spreading conflict, because I'm interacting with people who I can't expect to accept me for who I am. When I am with my friends, I expect that onus to be removed and basically to be given "consideration" instead of neutral treatment.  
  
If you force me to behave neutrally by becoming combative if I am anything but neutral, we will not become good friends.  You may think we are good friends because **I** know **you**, but in my mind we will not be because you will not know me and have demonstrated that you will not accept the real me.  You do not want me, you want a copy of yourself.  We are thus forever acquaintances on my side.  You cannot only accept friendship from carbon-copies of yourself.

I want it changed. I was not "bullied" in school growing up, nor did I "bully" anybody. That is not to say I never said something shitty to somebody and felt bad, or never had my feelings hurt by people either. I just feel that bullying is one of those things that is self-correcting. Over-coddling children and coming to their rescue never teaches people to actually solve their problems. It also is harmful to the bullies, who are often times misguided kids with problems of their own (maybe they would benefit from a bunch of other kids eventually saying to stop). I just think that adult intervention in bullying causes the victims to not have to remedy problems themselves, and it never gives the bullies a true, natural realization that what they are doing is wrong.  
  
It just seems that of course it isn't fair, but neither is anything in life. There are plenty of terrible situations in life where you will find yourself being the victim in one way or another, and in those situations you typically need to find a way to solve the problem, avoid the problem, or cope with something.   
  
One more disclaimer, obviously it is a tragedy when some people take drastic responses to being bullied and that definitely is not okay. But I would prefer adults and teachers focused on helping the victims work with their problems than to ONLY try to locate and punish bullies.

Breakfast is important because it is the first meal you eat after sleeping for considerable amount of time. During this time, you are fasting, and there is no need for your body to metabolise food. However, if you fail to eat when you wake up, your body gets into the habit of needing to conserve your energy for even longer than the 8 or so hours. This means your metabolism slows down, and if you eat the same amount of food as someone else that spreads it out throughout the day, you are far more likely to put on weight, as your body tries to conserve every portion of food you have, as it cant work out when it will next get a feed.Another drawback of this slowed metabolism is that as energy is needed to be conserved, this energy can't be used to think at work/school, or just generally be energetic about your day. Of course, everyone is different and you seem to have a pretty decent metabolism if you are still at a healthy weight etc. Just keep in mind that eating breakfast may increase your ability to concentrate, even if you think you are doing ok right now (:

However, I disagree with /u/TuckerTheCat concerning 'reading other people's misery will make you appreciate your own stuff more and make you happier'. I don't know of any person who stopped complaining about their commute / study work after they read about the newest terrorist attack somewhere in Africa. Even if your rebuttal is 'yeah but that's too far away' consider this: people might appreciate a roof over their heads more when they read about homeless rates going up, but it doesn't make you happier. IMO (can't back this up, just my personal feeling with it).  
  
However, I still recommend reading the news. *Understanding* why things are the way they are is my key to happiness. It brings mental peace knowing that many of those evil things that happen is just human behavior in some historic, economic, and political context.

I think that through time, people have understood that incest is wrong not specifically under the terms of immorality [when considering that both parties are consensual adults] but under the consideration of maintaining a healthy gene pool. It would have been observed that inbreeding causes a collapse in the genetic health of a population. Back in hunter gatherer times, and even in the primate world, there are inbuilt selective protocols for ensuring that genetic diversity  is maintained – either females leave to go to other tribes or males leave to look for females. 

Many cultures have elaborate mating law for who you can or cannot marry based on how closely related they are to you, the Australian Aboriginals have one, a very intricate one based on ‘skin’ clan groups. It has the effect of making incest a taboo. Now the basis of it is to keep the population healthy. However, way back when, people didn’t understand the genetic mechanics of it all, just that when there was inbreeding, the offspring ended up retarded. This may have been understood in a moral capacity [spiritual or religious] because people didn’t know how ELSE to understand it or even to enforce it, even though the considerations here are purely about keeping the tribe healthy. 

On a personal level, it is wrong in the sense that your children will have more of a chance of being retarded and it damages your own genetic legacy as well as the lives of those you produce… so it’s a betrayal to the 3.5 billion years of successful reproduction that has come before you. I would say that this is how the wrongness of it can be understood in relation to how it can damage the health of people, your personal genetic fitness and legacy, and ‘the tribe’. Homosexuality can reduce a person’s individual fitness [fitness here is about how many offspring you leave, it’s an evolutionary term] but not necessarily that of other people or the tribe in a direct physical sense.

The reasons I think murder is still morally wrong, despite the person being reincarnated the next day as though the act had never occurred, are the following:

* **The big R.** Let’s cut right to it. If murder is okay, then rape is okay, and now you are really in a dark place.
 
* **The mouse in the glue trap.** There are no consequences for leaving a mouse in a glue trap to die slowly of dehydration or self-inflicted wounds, but many would agree that it is moral to end the mouse’s suffering quickly. The mouse dies either way, but the moral choice is to minimize pain and suffering. In a Groundhog Day murder there are also no consequences, but you are increasing pain and suffering. Even a swift murder causes some pain and suffering in others, and if it’s not swift you’ve left someone to suffer for potentially hours.

* **Consequences to one’s self.** The emotional trauma you inflict on yourself is immoral. You have created unnecessary pain and suffering for yourself, and this does carry over to the next day, and the day after that.

I have met many people who have casually agreed that murder is okay in a Groundhog Day scenario, and I often assume this is a nod to their own immorality. But, admittedly, I’ve never lived the same day over and over again, so maybe I’m overlooking some variables that would change the rules of the game.

Edit: Okay, I had to sleep, and now I'm at work, but some more responses have piled up. I'll try to take a look at each response sometime throughout the day to give some consideration everybody's perspectives.

This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring.  After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring.

There are several reasons why to buy a diamond


1)	The cartel has broken.

You expressed some concern saying “I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market.”  While that still is true to a certain extent the big cartel player (De Beers) has finally been broken.  In 2000 producers in Russia, Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “blood diamonds”  and De Beers has been losing market share.  De Beers’ market share fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to less than 40% in 2012.  In 2011 the Oppenheimer family announced their intention to sell the entirety of their 40% share.  Price manipulation is now far more difficult. You could argue at this point in 2013, there is no manipulation and it is simply the market. 


2)	You’re not buying the rough diamond, you’re buying the art.

Diamonds are expensive.  I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon, I mean hell so is my ass.  So why are they so expensive?  It’s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond.  These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic.  Cut, the most important quality in my opinion, is almost entirely dependent on the skill of the diamond cutter.  And even the carat is dependent on the diamond cutter not cutting too much.  What this means of course is no diamond is the same.  That may sound lame but it’s true.  Small differences in facet pattern can produce large differences in the pattern of light that is reflected off the stone.  Every diamond has its own “fire and brilliance” pattern.


3)	The expense per day of use is very small.

But diamonds are still expensive.  I spent around $5000 for my engagement ring I gave to my fiancée, a lot right now, but she wears it every. single. day.  And if we stay together for 50 years (perfectly reasonable considering our age) this means that the per day usage is $0.27!   

4)	There are alternatives to mined diamonds.


Now you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond.  I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like [here](http://gemesis.com/).  They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive.  I didn’t buy from them because they didn’t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren’t that great at producing pure colorless yet.  But they appear to be getting better and better.  Of course they are about the same price for freaking carbon, but that’s because these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds.  Furthermore you could argue that the technology needed to make these is an art in itself.  


5)	You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it.

Finally it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day.  Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does; I know why I chose a “modified brilliant cut” over an “old mine cut” and how it suits her and her personality.  Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means; this stone, this diamond, on my fiancée’s finger, grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano, to then be found, mined, cut, polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée.  Sometimes while on the couch with her, I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine, produce, and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it.  


You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it’s a steal.

*As an American who has never smoked anything in his life, never done drugs (maybe a few contact highs), and doesn't drink that much, this is what worked for me.  You know yourself, your situation and if these things might help.*
  
To be honest.  So long as you are a good/fun person to be around, you can make A LOT of friends by being the sober one.

I never went to college, but in the barracks (dorm rooms) on base I had people I never knew seek me out to have me drive their expensive sports car/SUV for them.  Being the DD has its advantages.    

Being the only sober one is only a bad thing is you want it to be.  Sure people will tease you about it, but you will be teased about something regardless, that just happens to be an easy target.

So don't feel as if you have to drink to have friends.  You have to be friendly/social to have friends.

That said,  if you really want to not exclude yourself most people can have a single beer and not get uncontrollably drunk.  Even lightweights.

So if it's that much a worry, my suggestion is this.  Next party or social setting you go to, have a single beer and stop there.  Keep that red solo cup (or bottle) half full and just walk around carrying it  (an empty cup is an invitation for someone to get you another).  If you have been able to fend off friends trying to get you to drink already, you can probably have a single drink and stop there for the night.  People will tease you for nursing it, or whatnot.  again, most of this is good natured ribbing.  Nothing to worry about.  Just explain you might have to DD tonight or something is they insist (and they probably will).

Do that a few times.  You're friends and peers will not care that you don't get blackout drunk with them. Especially when you will likely be the only reason they got home when they did.  After a couple times of this kind of thing, people will just know you as the guy who doesn't get wasted.  OWN THAT SHIT.  That's you, don't be embarrassed to be described that way.  Be proud of it and be confused as to why someone would not want to be like you because you are awesome.

It sounds like you might be a bit insecure about yourself and your choices (most people are at that age and some just know how to hide it better).  I would suggest a subreddit like /r/seddit .  It has a bad reputation but in reality seduction is all about being the best you possible.  When you are awesome, friends (male and female) will naturally come to you:  Because who the fuck wouldn't want to be my friend?  I'm awesome!  This kind of community is something I wish I found years ago at your age becasue I was painfully shy for far too long (and still am truthfully)

As for drugs and smoking.  No reason to ever start.  Anytime someone bothers you about it, just say it's not your thing.  Don't talk down to them about it, don't say is gross or dangerous or expensive or any of that stuff.  That will just start an argument and will do nothing but get you excluded.  If anyone pushes much more than that ask them why it's such a big deal to them.  *You* direct the flow of conversation at *them* and their insistence. Let them be defensive instead.  If they still push you and insist, they aren't friends and aren't worth being around if you have to do things you don't want to in order to be around them.  Fuck 'em.

So I think the opportunity for any kind of stable climate has passed us by, and the climate will continue to warm until civilization cannot be sustained.

I work in an art gallery. You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre-1950s that manages to survive. There were big trends of "artists" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top, because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent. Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand. There will always be amateurs, con artists, and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era.  
  
Also, you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art. There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today, but as with all kinds of creations, most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like. I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites. For now, pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now. Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website: [David Mach's coat hanger sculpture] (http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/david-machs-coat-hanger-sculptures), [Chiharu Shiota's installations](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/installations-by-chiharu-shiota), and [Stephanie Clark's embrodiery](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/embroidered-architecture-by-stephanie-kelly).  
  
It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online (eg video, the texture of string, illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room). If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries, you're missing a lot of great stuff.

I’m a woman.  I’ve never done any formal reading on women’s studies (probably everything I know comes from reddit, whatever that’s worth). In any case, I most certainly have heard that rape is about power, domination, violence, etc. and so forth – but not about sex. It sounded weird when I first heard it many years ago (probably in a movie or on the news, who knows) and honestly it still does. If rape isn’t about sex, why does sex occur instead of just non-sexual violence or abuse? I guess I don’t get it.

In the comments of [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kbeez/i_believe_that_pornographys_overall_net_impact_on/) on pornography from yesterday, u/Medicalizawhat posted a link to [this article] (http://www.drtraycehansen.com/Pages/writings_politics.html) about rape, power, politics, feminists, etc. It was an interesting read. I don’t know anything about Trayce Hansen, I trust him just as much as any rando on the internet (not a lot), but much of what he said makes sense (I’m ignoring the broad fairly negative brush with which he seems to like painting feminists).

Anyway, I believe that while some rape is undoubtedly about power, **most** rape is about sex. Some people want it (men, women, ducks) and they don’t mind “taking” what they want, even when it is not freely offered. For the record, I have seen the studies saying  that rapists admit to selecting the most submissive victims rather than the most attractive: I don't think this conclusively proves rape is about power. It seems just as likely that rapists are not complete idiots and while they want to satisfy their sexual urges, they still pick the targets that are low effort and low risk (of being vocal, reporting, etc).

My belief doesn’t mean that I deny rape culture (pretty hard to argue after Steubenville, no?) and I don’t think that this means anyone should change what they are wearing (“well, dressed like that, she was ASKING for it!!!”) or their actions (“what did he expect, getting blackout drunk and falling asleep next to someone he doesn’t know, of course he wanted it”). Likewise, my belief that rape is usually about sex doesn’t excuse anyone from even an iota of the blame (except maybe ducks): human men and women alike are both absolutely capable of stifling their sexual urges/desires and it should be the barest of expectations in a civilized society no matter what someone is wearing or how they are acting.

So yea… CMV!

Morality...good vs. evil...right vs. wrong...these concepts have plagued humanity since we became conscious of ourselves.  As a current example, what is your stance on abortion? The death penalty? Illegal immigration?  Chances are you are either for or against, but I would imagine the more intellectually minded of would respond with "What are the circumstances?"
In the case of abortion, would your stance change if the pregnancy could kill the mother?  Would you change your stance on death penalty if it was that of a man who broke into your home and raped your wife or child?  Does your view of 'illegal immigration' change when you realize they just want a 'better life?'  
Apply these questions to yourself, analyze them, think on them.  In the presence of intense scrutiny by logic and reason, good and evil become non-factors.  Using arguments from morality turn what should be an objective debate into blind subjectivity, and bring progress to a halt.  This is why I believe that reason and logic are the true means to justice and morality is but a mere façade.

Edit: Well, this has been such an interesting discussion that I am having difficulty concentrating on my research.  Thank you all for your participation, some of you helped me discover new angles of analyzing the question.  Enjoy your days!

**Let me get one thing out of the way...**I'm really not interested in hearing arguments related to hitting a child in order to save them from harm; for example, *"I jerked by kid back because he was about to run into oncoming traffic"* or *"I slapped my child's hand away because he was about to touch a hot stove"*. In those cases, you're taking the lesser of two evils, I'd much rather a child get pushed back than getting hit by a car.  
   
Now, where the problem occurs....  
 
• Bad grades   
• Staying out late  
• Screaming in a grocery store  
• Pissing you off  
•  etc etc  
  
The list is endless, it's what kids do. My problem lies in parents who feel the need to discipline their children by hitting them, even lightly. The fact of the matter is these children are defenseless and have the right to live in an environment where they do not have to worry about being hit by their parents. For those who say *"Don't tell me how to raise my kid"*, it has nothing to do with you, it has everything to do with your child. No one excuses parents who use the same argument if they, for example, refuse medical care. The fact is, if you hit your child, you're a criminal.  
  
**Your anger does not justify hitting a child**. Here's my rule of thumb: As a subordinate to your boss, **anything your boss can not do to you, you should not be able to do to your child**. If your boss hit you, you'd sue and they'd be arrested. However we give a pass to parents when in that case, it's 100x worse considering we have a grown adult attacking a child.

To me, the Tea Party exemplifies the worst of current American politics. Their policies (such as they can be said to exist for such a loosely defined group) are rooted in ignorance and—often—racism.

* Any elected official who identifies as a member of the Tea Party will do concrete harm to our country with such power as they are able to wield.
* Any American who agrees with the Tea Party is demonstrably ignorant to such a degree as to be a danger to society, in terms of both (a) the power they wield as a citizen to elect those who make and enforce our laws and (b) how they interact with others in their personal lives.

**I therefore posit that the benefits to the United States would strongly outweigh the negative effects if everyone who identifies with the Tea Party in any way were to immediately magically vanish from the planet.**

For the purposes of this hypothetical, the Tea Party supporters are not harmed in any way. "Harm" would include destruction; you could imagine that they're transferred to a new Earth where everyone else has been replaced with [p-zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) duplicates, such that everything will continue normally from the perspective of the Tea Partiers. Nothing changes on the original Earth except the disappearance; people are aware that the Tea Party supporters have vanished.

Let's talk about it: Change my view! I will do my best to reply to everyone who makes an good-faith attempt to engage in discussion; as I tend to post mostly from work, I may not always be able to respond immediately.

**Clarifications in response to/summations of major responses:**

1. *"Even the worst viewpoints are useful, because they offer an opportunity to publicly challenge them/define better policies in opposition to them."* This is the best argument I've yet seen. However, I'm not yet convinced that this is enough to cancel out the benefits that would be gained, or to outweigh the risk that those bad policies would be enacted even after debate.
1. *"Silencing someone because you disagree with their opinion is unAmerican."* Absolutely agreed, but that's not what this hypothetical is about. It's not "we should get rid of Tea Partiers," it's "the U.S. would be better off without Tea Partiers," *without any action having been taken by anyone for this removal to occur*. The difference may seem subtle, but I believe it's essential.
2. *"Is it okay for people to be ignorant, as long as they're not Tea Party members?"* I believe there is no other movement in the U.S. with significant power that has a similarly universal basis in ignorance.
3. *"How do you define the Tea Party/who are its members?"* For the purposes of this hypothetical, I would define it as it defines itself. Politicians and other supporters would be defined by self-identification.
4. *"Even if the Tea Party disappeared, it wouldn't solve all of Americas problems."* I'm not saying it would. But I do believe that the United States would be improved overall if the Tea Party no longer had influence over any level of society. "Better" doesn't mean "perfect" or even "good."
5. *"Losing a large percentage of the population would have negative economic effects."* Definitely. But how many Tea Partiers are there, and would those negative effects be outweighed by the gains from the absence of their influence?

I am seeing a lot of downvoting in this thread across both sides, so I'd like to remind people who may be new to CMV of the [guidelines of this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#link2):

**Downvotes don't change views. Vote based on the quality of the comment, not whether you agree or not.**

There will be many differing viewpoints shared here. If everyone downvoted based on their own opinions, then everyone would be downvoting each other! See below for more details.

## **Upvoting/Downvoting**

**Please don't use downvote buttons (except on offensive or rule-breaking posts, which you should really report instead).** When you disagree with a claim, try to refute it! When you find a new post you disagree with, remember that the poster is inviting debate, so consider *upvoting* it to make it more likely that people who agree with you will join you in revealing the post's faults.

And we'd also like you to stop and think before downvoting a comment by the author of a thread (its "original poster" or OP). Say someone provides a counter argument to OP's view, but it doesn't quite do the job, and OP replies explaining why it's still difficult for her to change her opinion. Far too many times have we seen these types of comments from OP being downvoted. This is frustrating to see as OP is being *honest* about her (perhaps controversial) opinion and is (hopefully) open to it being changed. Please don't downvote if they are explaining why a point is still not convincing them.

Look, we kinda think downvotes suck. We want all interesting and thoughtful conversations to rise to the top, and the problem with downvotes is that it's perfectly possible for unpopular ideas to be interesting and thoughtful, yet many Redditors instinctively downvote claims they disagree with. The Reddit community has been accused of suffering from polarization and groupthink, and the voting system contributes to this issue. If we could remove the downvote button altogether we probably would, but we can't. (We can use CSS to try to kill the buttons, but some redditors choose not to experience subs' CSS themes, and users of third party apps like Alien Blue are also immune to this technique. So killing downvotes with CSS is worse than doing nothing because it gives a subset of redditors an amplified downvoting voice). So please resist the urge to downvote. Thanks. :-)

Many people do not live in the city or state they grew up or called home. Following their "home team" give them a sense of comfort because the team represents home. It allows someone to carry a piece of home with them no matter where they are.
&gt;When people are dying across the world due to civil war and starvation...    
    
This is a very grim thought, but realistically the average person cannot drastically change those bad things from happening. Like the movies during the depression sports provide a temporary escape from the worries of life.    
Furthermore, this last one is a little stereotypical but usually sports fans like to compete. Following, talking about, comparing sports teams fulfills that need.

Don´t vote if you don´t want to. You are only one person, but if everybody starts thinking that way, you won´t be alone for long. I assume you see the problematic in that.

There are people who don´t vote, because they don´t like any partie. You just don´t vote because you are lazy. Imagine everybody would do that, or even 25% would just not go voting because they´re lazy. The outcome wouldn´t be representative.

In my opinion you can stay at home if you want to, but it is important that your friend has his opinion, to stop everyone from following in your track.

If everybody having your opinion would decide to go vote, the outcome would absolutely change. So the quest isn´t to convice you, it is to convince every not-voter.

I can’t help it. I know it might be a logical fallacy. I consider myself a relatively open-minded individual, but this subject matter just shuts my brain off from wanting to investigate further. As soon as someone says they think something was part of “conspiracy” can’t get past wondering the size of their head so I can get them properly fitted for a tin-foil hat.

I know this is broad subject matter, but I recently came to terms with my opinion on conspiracy theorists after reading a friends Facebook post yesterday. Now, traditionally I would consider this individual relatively smart and typically pretty insightful. I started reading her post about the Boston Marathon bombing. It lead off with describing her feelings on the tragic incident, but quickly turning into her explaining how she believes the bombing was part of a “conspiracy” by the American government to essentially rekindle the American public’s flame for the “War on Terror”. Although I read the “explanation” for this opinion I didn’t consider the points with any sort of weight.

Now this is where my logical fallacy might come into play… I guess the primary issue I have with conspiracy theorists are I’m not aware of any sizable conspiracy theories that ever have been proven, without a doubt, to be true. I’ve seen the conspiracy coin flipped thousands of times, always coming up tails; I can’t help from believing it that it’s likely it will continue to do so.

Obama is by no means innocent in this. "Campaign Obama" was very critical of the Bush-era surveillance programs. Even in his 2009 inaugural address, he said "“As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.” Fast forward to today, and not only has he done nothing to roll back these programs, but has greatly expanded them and actively defends them as necessary tools to "protect" us from terrorism etc.

Although you are correct however that the blame doesn't lay solely with him. 

- All the congress members that voted for all these controversial acts over the years that got us in this mess, they are all guilty as well IMO. 

- The senators like Dianne Feinstein and John McCain who were "in the know" and totally OK with all of this. 

-  The Judges who should have put a stop to this, but allowed everything to continue on in secret.

- The tech/communications companies that bent over backwards to help the government spy on their customers. (Although in all fairness, I don't think they have really had a chance to tell their side of the story yet. I don't think we know at this point exactly how much pressure was put on them by the government to go along with this.)

This is what angers and frustrates me more than anything else, is the fact that **so many** of our representatives and public officials were in on this, and kept secret from the public how far the extent of this program is. In my opinion there are a lot of government employees that *at the very least* should be losing their jobs over this.

I agree about the shittiness of desert as a criterion of distributive justice. (For my reasons, see J. Wolff's chapter in [this book](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199204250.do#.UdUYvxZU5Hw), which I agree with entirely.) But I don't agree about the correctness of utilitarianism. Besides the objections others have made, there are two points I want to bring up. The first is the phenomenon of *adaptive preferences*: if we take utility to be the satisfaction of preferences, then utility can be increased merely as people lower their expectations. Since human beings have been proven by social scientists to adjust their expectations to their circumstances (see Jon Elster, *Sour Grapes*), oppression—say, of slaves, or of women—does not reduce utility as much as one would think. But an eighteenth-century Christian housewife's being content with her situation wouldn't justify her deprivation of important opportunities for self-development and for autonomy. Preferences are not the only thing that matters from the perspective of justice, or of moral goodness.

The second point is the impossibility of *interpersonal comparisons* of utility. Regardless of how you conceive of utility, there will be no way to sum people's utility together to produce anything like a total utility function. If you conceive of utility as being a sort of mental state—pleasure or desire-fulfillment—then you run immediately into the problem of measurement and quantification: in the words of 19th-century utilitarian economist W. S. Jevons, "Every mind is inscrutable to every other mind and no common denominator of feelings is possible." In light of this, people started conceiving of utility as preference satisfaction: I might not be able to give an absolute value to a mental state *a* or *b* and know how that compares to someone's else's mental states *c* or *d*, but I can tell if I prefer doing *x* or doing *y*. But there's a problem. Amartya Sen puts it well:

&gt;This approach has the advantage of not requiring that we undertake the difficult exercise of comparing different persons' mental conditions (such as pleasures or desires), but correspondingly, it closes the door *altogether* to the possibility of direct interpersonal comparisons of utilities (utility is each individual's separately scaled representation of her preferences). Since a person does not really have the option of becoming someone else, interpersonal comparisons of choice-based utility cannot be "read off" from the actual choices. (*Development as Freedom*, 86)

So it's impossible to know whether we're maximizing utility because utilities cannot be plugged into any kind of meaningful function for a population larger than one. At best, utilitarianism is an impracticable idea; at worst, not even philosophically coherent.

Once elected officials are elected, we give them a huge amount of power over us. Republicanism flaws society and government in the sense that it puts our government against us in most scenarios and creates a "them" and "us" mentality to a degree. 
 
We grant representatives an extraordinary amount of power with little oversight from the people. Sure they have incentives to appease their constituents, but they also have the revolving door, and the interests of other politicians. Representative governments become more the interests of the politicians rather than the people.
 
Another problem with Republicanism is that it relies on a certain society in order to function properly. Vast majority of Americans don't vote, and an even greater majority of the voting population don't educate themselves on who they are voting for. Many Americans are dedicated to a party, not a candidate.
 
I believe that if we expanded the powers of the people, and integrated the people into their government we would have a much more prosperous, happier country and quite possibly the world with our influence in foreign affairs. Such powers of the people would be more voting powers on national issues, a structured way for the removal of certain representatives at any given time, and a government program for anyone to run for a political office with certain, reasonable criteria (such as so many people supporting this candidate prior to allocation of funds). I believe that in order to achieve this, however, we must acheive a society that values and focuses on education, a country that spends more on education than defense.

Your proposition, *the categorization of fallacious trivialities*, is meaningless. Not because you do not make a solid case, but because you included the term “almost every philosophical question”. The only way one can proof or disproof this, is to find all “every philosophical questions” and make an operational definition of the term “almost”.

Also, your fifth, number 3, category:  How can one know that purely philosophical reasoning can bring us closer to the truth? And what is “purely” philosophical reasoning? Does this imply impure philosophical reasoning? This category is your failsafe category, just like the usage of the word “almost” is in your introduction. If all fails, then there is a way to fit it in. 

You use this with **Epistemology - Molyneux problem**, but let’s be fair: Philosophy asked the question, science (if you insist not seeing science as a part of philosophy) answered it. This it’s not an appeal to influence, this is casualty. Where there are no questions asked, no answers are given.

&gt; According to Feisal Abdul Rauf, "the Quran expressly and unambiguously prohibits the use of coercion in faith because coercion would violate a fundamental human right—the right to a free conscience. A different belief system is not deemed a legitimate cause for violence or war under Islamic law. The Quran is categorical on this: "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256); "Say to the disbelievers [that is, atheists, or polytheists, namely those who reject God] "To you, your beliefs, to me, mine" (109:1-6)"

Now, if those verses hold true, then that is a direct contradiction to the verses you have brought up. If one has to follow both to be a "proper Muslim", then there is no such thing. I suppose that could be your view, but that would mean all of the billions of people claiming to be Muslims are not.

&gt;Jawaid Quddus asserts that "Quotations from the Quran, cited out of historical context, are being used to prove the contention that Islam is by nature and design a violent religion."

I think this quote is important because, despite owning a Koran, you still cannot get all of the context required to fully understand it. I commend you for reading large sections of the Koran, but it still isn't enough. A biblical example of this would be Jesus's "go another mile carrying armor" parable. Most everyone thinks that the parable just means to be nice to soldiers, but the meaning to those who originally heard it was much different, involving sections of Roman law about carrying armor.

Anyways, there are more things in there regarding specific verses, but unfortunately none of the ones you quoted are dealt with. If you want to read them all, I can quote some, but an overall statement is usually more effective than a specific verse-by-verse analysis.
ERROR:
That's not a very sophisticated use of "proper". Sure, if "proper" means something like, "most orthodox", you can expect to find the violent, fanatical, and apocalyptic tendencies you describe—that sounds like a truism. However, if "proper" is akin to "mainstream", I would find classifying the majority of the world's 1.25 billion Muslims as terrorists to be distasteful and absurd. Point being that no one has a monopoly on what constitutes a "proper Muslim"; but it seems more fair to define it closer to the middle rather than scoping out the fringe.

Flushing a toilet uses about 1.5 gallons, or almost 7 liters, of water. Doing this 4 times in a day uses 6 gallons, or about 28 liters of water a day. This is a huge amount and shouldnt be wasted. It can also save on bills too but only by about £30-40 per year(going by the 4 flushes a day at 2p per flush).

I'm mainly referring to guys, it'll be a bit of a hassle for women.

&gt;Thats disgusting, it'll cause the bathroom and the house to stink!  

When you run the water to quickly wash your hands after, it will wash away any pee that is in the pipes. Just like when you wash dirt off your hands it washes the dirt away, it doesn't sit down the plug hole leaving a smell.

&gt;It's germy, it'll probably spread diseases, eww, i think im gonna puke

Pee is sterile, you cant catch anything from it unless maybe if the person has an infection, im not sure about that. Either way, what i said in the first point about it getting washed away will fix this issue anyway.

&gt;Why not just pee in the toilet but just dont flush it until you need to? you freak.

Well, this WILL cause the place to smell, you just had a go at me for that. It'll just be like having a bowl of pee in the bathroom.

&gt;It's disgusting, you're disgusting!

Thats just a social construct. Just like how i(and most) think eating a Snail is gross but then the French seem to think its fine.

edit: i just want to add that its easier and quicker too. Like you dont need to aim much, you just point straight and you cant miss and hit the seat or anything. You can also pretty much start running the tap as you finish too and go straight to hand washing.

edit 2: Just to give a bit of info on why i first tried this it was because flushing a toilet can be noisey and i dont like flushing in the middle of the night so one night i decided to pee in the sink to avoid waking anybody. So thats another advantage i guess, if you live in a small house with a non quiet toilet then it will eliminate the chance of waking anybody.

edit 3: Where i live sometimes we have hose pipe bans when there are water shortages. This means that you cant wash your car or water your grass in the summer unless you do the whole lawn with a watering can. I think that peeing in the sink would save a loadddd more water than a hose pipe ban since for every 1 time somebody uses a hose pipe, 100 toilets are flushed just because of pee.

You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate. However, that isn't really how it works.

I'm a trans guy and I like a lot of different things: a lot are 'masculine dudebro' things and a lot aren't. In the course of a single day I can spend hours playing video games, reading or watching shitty TV shows ranging from Pawn Stars to Hannah Montana. I don't regard any of these things as 'female' parts of me. I am inherently male. There is not other way to describe it; it is just who I am. I know that I am a man the same way that I know that I am attracted to women or anything else intuitive. It's absolutely integral to my identity. 

If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles, I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress. On to your point about how we are perceived in society: you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria. Hearing 'ma'am' or 'miss' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person. 

It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it: one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call 'schemas' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word. Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says 'little old lady' or 'Scotsman'. The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task. 

These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people. So basically gender roles are a schema: girls do this, boys do that. My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a *generalisation* which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well. Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys (assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone). Equally, there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum: outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles. This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid. 

If you can't tell from my previous points, I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles: used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (they should, of course, never be forced on someone against their will). They exist for a reason, that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided 'Aha, I should file that!' However, that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between. It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women.

The second reason is that, for our emotional well-being, us trans folks absolutely *need* to be gendered correctly. It is pivotal to our survival. As such, there is a huge need to 'pass' within the trans community: the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as. It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves; however, getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle. As such, it is just easier to conform (and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community).

So basically, in my opinion, it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes *must* be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes *must* be a man: it is that these people are women/men and as such align with some (but generally not all) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted, to some extent, in truth.

I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other, more specific questions, then go right ahead!

Okay, well in your explanation your constructed a figurative slippery slope – where one drink leads to two, leads to four, and on and on. I guess what I'm saying is that's still your choice to drink the first drink. It's your choice to be in a place with other people who can help you make safe decisions. It's your choice to get drunk, and if you're responsible for the first drink, you're responsible for the rest of it too.

And simply because you are impaired doesn't mean you have no control. Am I responsible for hitting another car even though I was really tired and not paying attention while driving? Of course.

Hi CMV. I'm sure this won't be a popular post, because anytime I see any sort of numbers or facts on the issue thrown around, they get buried. However, I really want to discuss this, and listen to other sides of the story. I do not want racist thoughts, and I do not want to feel like I hate a majority based on their skin color. That being said, black people are, allegedly, more violent. It makes them scary, and regardless of color, I would avoid violent individuals at all costs. Moot point, one that a bunch of you may find comical: one of my best friends is black. I love him more than any other person on this planet. I understand that what I am about to post does not apply to ALL black people -- but I do feel like it is a huge majority.

This is the image that started all of this for me: [2010 National Crime Victimization Survey Infographic](http://i.imgur.com/haSEQTV.jpg)

That absolutely blew my mind. I felt validated -- that everything I had thought up to that point about the violence permeating black culture was true. The numbers don't lie, do they?

**Point**: Poverty. Poverty breeds violence, and it can be seen in nations all across the world. As an anecdotal addition to my post -- for the first 16 years of my life I was in the lowest bracket of poverty imaginable. I realize this is not true for a lot of people, but I have not, nor will I ever be a violent person. Poverty did not make me violent, and many peers of mine who were in the same situation as children, or even as adults, are not violent whatsoever. I do not think that poverty is an excuse for violence. I do not think that there is ANY excuse for violence, even with institutionalized racism and poverty abound. Especially as young adults or adults, we are responsible for our own actions, and no amount of excusing it makes up for the numbers in the infographic. None. It's sickening, regardless of color.

I cannot think of ANY situation where violence is acceptable other than self-defense. That is part of the reason why I don't understand the other side of the argument -- it is never acceptable, and there is *literally* no excuse for it. 

Why, then, is it so common for black people to commit heinous crimes when they represent a very SMALL portion of the United States?

**Point**: Slavery and discrimination. Every race on the face of the planet has been enslaved at one point or another. Every PERSON on this planet has been discriminated against one way or another. Neither one of these, whether institutionalized or a small, vocal group of people are an excuse to enact violence upon another human being.

**TL;DR:**

&gt;While representing a small minority of the population in the United States **(12.6%)**, 62.5k black people were a victim of white violence, and 320k white people were a victim of black violence.


&gt;According to the infographic and the provided sources, this is what would occur if the 13% (rounded) population of black people were to suddenly vanish from the United States.

- The prison population would go down by 37%.
- Almost 50% less gang members in the USA.
- Rape would go down "significantly".
- Overweight/Obesity would go down 10%.
- Average IQ would go up 7 points.
- SAT scores would go up by about 100 points.
- ACT scores would go up by 5.5 points.
- AIDS and HIV would go down by over 67%.
- Chlamydia cases would go down by 50%.
- Gonorrhea would go down by 69%.
- Syphilis would go down by 58%.
- Average income would go up 20k+
- Amount of people in poverty would go down 58%.
- Homelessness would go down by 57%.
- Number of welfare recipients would go down by about 40%.

13% of the population. **13%!**

All sources can be found in the infographic link.

Help me out -- CMV. I don't want to be a racist, but I also can't deny facts.


*EDIT*: **Thank you everyone for the input. Views changed, and I feel like I can relax a little bit. Evidently the infographic is complete bullshit when paired with other statistics instead of being cherry picked. This is my first experience with CMV and although rather harsh, it's been beneficial. I won't reply anymore to this thread -- and thank you again.**

This subject has been on my mind lately because of the case of Freddie Gray’s death. Long story short, Gray looked “suspicious” and gave chase. It’s still unclear when/how (was it on the foot chase? was it during the “rough ride”?) his spinal chord was severed 80% at the neck, but it was. He didn’t get medical attention for at least 30 minutes and within an hour, he was in a coma. He died a week later. 6 police officers have been suspended pending an investigation. One of these officers has invoked their Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination.


It just inherently sounds wrong to me and I’ll try to explain why through this thought process:

- Police officers are given authority over civilians through virtue of enforcing the law.

- With great power comes great responsibility. They have more power than the average person, so they should be held to a higher standard. Police officers are supposed to enforce the law, so they shouldn’t be allowed to impede it.

- Police officers get power and authority. Civilians are subject to this authority and therefore have certain rights and protections against it. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t have both power/authority AND protections from it. If a police officer did something criminal while working in their official capacity, they should not have the same protections as civilians.


Just to be clear, I’m specifically speaking about instances when a police officer is working in his official capacity.

It appears that the Oregon legislature chose to recognize same sex couples as a protected class and passed laws that made denying service to them illegal the same way that denying service to people on account of their race is illegal. I don't see how making a cake enables sodomy, I really don't know why that word even appears in this context since it's both irrelevant and even if it were, inapplicable in the linked situation since that deals with two women.   
  
By the way, there was no court involvement. This was a hearing conducted by the Oregon Board of Labor. Rights are only as strong as people's willingness to fight for them and assert them when those rights are violated.  
  
All that said, from my perspective, this amount is high if it is truly only for emotional distress. If this amount is also meant to be punitive, then it makes a little more sense. For the record, and I just checked, Oregon only allocates about 30% of the punitive damage award to the prevailing party, the rest is allocated to a state fund for low income legal aid in the State.

A thesaurus is a fantastic tool if you are writing an essay or a book and are trying to avoid using the same word over and over. It is about quick reference.

I have a problem with some of this stuff. First off, it ignores the communist revolts against the Vanguard Party. Yes, they declared that they were doing things on the behalf of the people, much like the French Revolutionaries before them. The problem is that people objected like in the Vendée or the Russian Peasant Armies they were met with violence. Lenin was complicit with launching coups against representative government and violent suppression of people seeking to protect their own interests. He did so while at the same time calling out labor union leaders for not recognizing that their own interests and objectives differed from those he led, never once realizing that the precise same dynamic was playing out with the Vanguard party and communism in general. Rather than coopting these other movements and incorporating the views of others they simply recreated a new autocratic political system modeled on Imperial Russia. This isn't uncommon in revolutions: when the English killed King Charles I they recreated first a military dictatorship and then reinstituted the Monarchy, when the French Revolted against the tyranny of their absolute monarchy they let absolute power fall into the hands of a small handful of radicals and eventually into the hands of one dictator. It turns out that autocratic and even tyrannical power is really, really useful for those who are in power. Lenin fell into a common trap. Instead of laying the groundwork to establish a stateless society he instead let the tyrannical tools and power of the old regime fall and be crushed by the people he immediately took it up and sought to use it to remake the world around him, just like the Czar before him and made the rise of a man like Stalin inevitable.

It's also important to note that many nations exploded in wealth and power. France, Germany, Belgium, and dozens of other nations were destroyed by a world War. Others such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and dozens of others were created from the corpses of those nations killed by that same war. Yet the 1920's was a time of remarkable growth across the board. The USSR wasn't even remarkable. It was only when the USSR was less impacted by the Great Depression that they bucked the trend, and that was largely because they were recovering slower and indeed lost to their neighbors in the prior decade.

No one here is arguing that Russia shouldn't have been a great power. They had been a great power for some time. But, the question here is whether or not Russia did great *because of* or *in spite of* their political and economic leadership.

There's a great deal of reason to suspect that it was *in spite of*. If you look at agricultural production you see some pretty serious losses in productivity with collectivization. This has been repeated time and time again. In the Soviet Union in the 20's and 30's. Again in the 50's in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. China's experiences with 5 year plans and the Great Leap Forward. Then again in the Socialist Ujaama villages in East Africa during the 70's. The mechanism being employed weren't just inferior to capitalistic production, but *inferior to the traditional production that preceded it*. The rejections of the value of local knowledge, the subordination of productivity to ideology, and fundamental flaws in Marxist Economics for no other reason that it failed to develop to accommodate new data because it was crushed under political orthodoxy that began with Lenin.

Industry was always the focus of Communist states. There were massive gains in this category, but that can arguably be a case of something being superior to nothing. You saw massive and impressive expansion of industry largely from scratch. Imperial Russia had functionally nothing. China less so. Both of these nations had demographics that made great power status inevitable but they were held back by backward and incompetent political leadership and economic structures. But even at their communist peaks Soviet products were always at a design disadvantage (especially for consumer goods), the incentives in the system were designed to promote an orthodoxy over productivity or quality, productivity was never equal to that of their rivals, and even when trade was possible you had things like Yugos trying to compete with Toyotas.

Compare South Korea and Japan to the track of North Korea or Russia.

Marx was a decent economist for his time, but you have to realize that the theory that he was working on was Ricardian. The premises he was working from were wrong.

Monopolies are not inevitable, but there are some conditions that promote them. With the proper incentives they can be prevented from forming. Usually monopolies we see are those with massive barriers to entry, often times the regulatory burdens just compound the problems inherent in running wires the to compete with Comcast.

Odd, because *some* planning has been successfully integrated into Capitalist economies, but systemic economic shortages is more often experienced by economies attempting centralized planning. *With perfect information* then a centrally planned economy *might* work out better *for the central authority* but long experience has demonstrated that putting that much power over capital in the hands of a small number of people ends badly.

I doubt that horse unemployment is really a thing. You see, the primary cause of a lack of rising wages in the West is largely a function of those jobs moving to developing nations, and people in those nations moving into industrial or service industries from subsistence agriculture. It's less that technology is resulting in fewer jobs, but rather that people who were previously excluded from having any jobs at all are now being included for the first time.

Employers aren't the only ones who decide the wages. When they have all the market power they can approach it, but wages often rise over the objection of owners when the value of labor rises. More generally standards of living tend to be higher when people have more control over their own surroundings, rather than delegating that power to some third party.

The problem is that the political elite and economic elite aren't necessarily the same people in a capitalistic society. Whenever you have a vanguard party taking over that is absolutely the case.

Everything is a ticking time bomb. As long as there is a structure that structure will collapse. Communism is a structure so whenever it is in place it would also be a ticking time bomb. The problem is that Capitalistic alternatives tend to both have *less* concentration of power and be *more* capable of adapting to challenges.

Capitalism will eventually collapse because entropy. Eventually it will morph into a form that cannot survive or because people will just decide to try something else. The problem is that the problems that Marx identified didn't result in the collapse of Capitalism when it "should" have simply because the form of capitalism that existed adapted properly to meet those challenges. As long as Capitalism is made to work then it will continue to persist. Vanguard-led revolutions that don't allow themselves to decompose into something fluid and cede power to their own people are far too rigid and incapable of adapting and will always collapse first.

TL;DR: The USSR was shackled by massive centralization of power and poor leadership. If people had been allowed to control their own capital then they would have done much better.

It really just seems to come down to supply and demand. Just about all of our paper comes from privately owned forests called "managed timberlands," where trees are grown specifically to be pulped for paper production. No need for paper? No need for the trees. So the question is, do you want to live on a planet with more trees, or less trees? If you want more, then use as much paper as possible. Boosting demand will boost supply, and, voilà! More trees!

Same goes for endangered species. You don't see cows going extinct any time soon, do you? Why? Because we eat them. Where there's a demand, there is (or will soon be) a supply. So if McDonalds started selling a McBengal patty melt, POOF! No more looming Bengal Tiger extinction.

I'm not actually suggesting that we start eating every endangered species, or that we go around wasting paper. But it makes sense on paper. What am I missing?

Of course not. For a movie to be good, the actors have to be good.

&gt; Lying is acting.

Maybe, in a way. But acting is not lying; it's much more. Acting means credibly pretending to be someone different; someone whose character, beliefs, emotions, habits, body etc. may be very different from your own. Theatre actors must be able to stay in character for the entirety of a play, while movie actors may have to do fairly many takes of the same scene without becoming any less convincing.

The KKK, WBC, ect. can discuss anything they want, any philosophy they want within the confines of their own church, meeting hall, ect.  The instant they bring their views outside the confines of their place of meeting and vocalize their views, they are open to criticism by society.  They can also ban people from their meetings who don't share their views or speak out against them.
  
Subreddits are like those meeting places.  Such hate groups on reddit you mentioned are free to discuss what they wish on their subs but as soon as their members bring their views outside their sub, they are open to criticism.  Similarly, like physical meeting places, people who disagree with their views can be banned from their subs.  
  
If you want to make the point that the subs are public, well so are a lot of church services.  If it bothers you that they show up in reddit search; well I'm sure the WBC and KKK shows up in the phone book and other directories as well.

I was watching a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode and they were discussing how one of the daughters wanted to be in a playboy magazine and the father was strongly opposed to it and said he wouldn't want to see his daughter on a playboy magazine even though he has been a subscriber for years. I think it's ok to take the stance that playboy, porn and other forms of "exposing art" are wrong, but if you are a subscriber or you consume this form of media you should not have the moral stance to say to your daughter; family member, etc, should not expose themselves in this form of media. I see it like if I was a massive meat eater and my daughter was a vegetarian, then one day she wanted to eat meat. I might not encourage her to do it for various of my beliefs, but because I eat meat I cannot oppose her choice as long as she is an adult. It seems extremely hypocritical IMHO since every single girl in those pornos and playboys are still someone's daughter and if you enjoy looking at them naked you should not be able to oppose someone like your daughter from doing them. Personally I am a consumer of porn, not gonna deny that much; and although I do not have a daughter at the moment, I would not encourage my daughter to do porn, but if she was an adult and made that choice, while I might not be fully comfortable with it, I should not be able to take a moral stance against it since I am a consumer. I am not interested in hearing explanations like “once you have a daughter you’ll understand” or “ imagine raising a kid and then seeing them one day having sex with 2 guys at once in front of the world” since once again, I do consume this form of media and every single one of those girls is “someones kid” and if I really had a problem with it I would not watch it to begin with.

A response I haven't seen, but seems important (at least to me) is "porqué no los dos?" Why are the NIT and traditional welfare mutually exclusive? Perhaps you could still have both. I doubt any NIT would be significant enough to truly raise everyone out of poverty, and moreover, even if it were to, are we going to leave people who don't spend their money wisely to starve? Especially the children of people who don't spend their money well, are they just screwed now? I think an NIT is a really good idea, I just don't think it should be mutually exclusive with a traditional welfare system but rather should be an addition to it

Just a note, I do not believe in Nazism.  
Now, I know this view is controversial and I know it's generally frowned upon but my lifelong belief is that eugenics isn't that bad. This started before I can even remember. I felt that people who live off of welfare and do nothing all day but drugs and get fat should lose their reproductive rights. At no time I believed people should die. I just think that people should lose their ability to reproduce until they have proven worth towards society. I don't think only one group of people should be singled out. In my mind, the only way for society to change for the better is to remove those who depend on warning labels and government funding. I get that older people or people with real disabilities need help but everyone knows who is working the system and milking it for money so they don't have to work. It's people who purposely do bad in job interviews and show no concern for their personal health. Don't get me wrong, I've met a lot of fat/overweight/etc.. people who are perfectly healthy and it is truly genetic. I just believe that if someone is purposely not working so they can live for free should not be allowed to have children. In my mind, it would be better for the genetic line to die out instead of being able to propagate and spread. Given that maybe their children will be successful in life but from what I have seen, they most likely are not.  
  
EDIT: I've changed my mind. Eugenics are not the best route to go. Education and opportunities is what builds empires. I still believe eugenics could be successful if we had more knowledge as a collective to determine who will be successful and who wouldn't be.

•By adding a new person to the world, I would contribute to overpopulation and the depletion of resources that is already straining existing people.

Overpopulation is somewhat of a myth.

In fact in many developed countries the population is decreasing.

•Because of said depletion of resources (not to mention political tensions, national debt, and so forth) my child would probably be subject to a less-than-ideal world.

I would argue that historically each human (on average) has created more resources that he has consumed. 

This is why we have progress, if you think about it. People create more than they consume, generating excess wealth that lead to all the wanders of human ingenuity you see all around you.

Look around, your computer, your chair, your house etc. etc.  were all created BECAUSE of the large number of humans who are alive.

Historically, most parents do all-right job.

So odds are in your favor.

•My biological kid might not even take after me in the ways I like. Even worse, what if I hate my kid? What if my kid is an asshole who actively makes the world a worse place?

Again, most children and parents have great relationships.

So the odds are in your favor.

•If there's no guarantee my kid will be like me anyway, why not just adopt a kid? Even if that nurturing instinct just cannot be suppressed, it seems like a horrible idea to add new people to the world unnecessarily.

Adopting is noble.

But if everyone was adopting instead of having new kids, the humanity would go extinct - not a good outcome.

•It's not like the human species is on the brink of extinction. So what if it goes extinct anyway? I have no investment in future generations.

Is not the DEFINTION of selfishness to only care about yourself and not about humanity?

In your OP you say there no unselfish reasons to have kids, yet now you use selfishness to justify your decision.  

There is clearly some inconsistent reasoning here.
ERROR:
I think you can approach this from 2 angles:   
  
First, the reason people have the drive to reproduce is biological - it is how our species survives, something that is so ingrained in us that it is one of the most powerful motivators we know. There must be some minimum number of people who *are* having biological children, otherwise we would cease to exist. Maybe you don't have a problem with that, but that is basically saying "existing is selfish", and by that logic, there is no non-selfish reason to continue living. If you were really interested in being selfless, you would stop consuming resources and cease to exist (obviously extreme, but you get my point).    
  
Second, in relationship to how many people there are in the world, the percentage of "extra" kids (that really should be adopted, whether because of financial reasons, orphans, etc) isn't tremendously high, especially in 1st world countries. That doesn't mean that adopting an orphan child from a 3rd world country isn't a *good* thing to do, because it is. But we are really talking about situations at the margins here, rather than something everyone should be doing.    
   
The other category of objections is more along the lines of wanting to be a good parent and have a good relationship with your child. That really is a bit of a crap-shoot, but you seem like a thoughtful person, and that goes a long way. Also, it wouldn't really change your odds (especially not for the better) if you adopted a child. That is likely to be a harder situation especially if the child was much different than you, so those objections, as points against having a *biological* child, don't really make that much sense.

Hi! I have been vegan for about the same time as you, and I found it staggeringly hard. I grew up in a family of five eating mostly cheap, processed foods, tons of meat and dairy, going out for McDonald’s at least once a week. I literally had no patience or desire to cook anything that didn’t come in a box. It took until very recently for me to be able to be comfortable with my cooking and eating habits, but I have to say that going vegan has been the most incredible joy of my life. I understand that you haven’t had the same experience, but I really do think it makes sense to stick with it — for both ethical and health reasons.

I went vegan because I realized that if I was vegetarian for ethical reasons, I could not justify not being vegan. I take your point — there is suffering inherently involved in pretty much anything we do. I do not specifically seek out local or fair trade products, but I still think it’s important to abstain from consuming anything that comes from animals. All we can really do when it comes to reducing, or refusing to be involved in practices we consider cruel is what is practical and possible for us. For me to specifically locate fair-trade, local, etc. products would be a difficult task — I would have to change where I buy most everything, and find replacements for virtually all the products I buy or use. It is not a matter of being consistent, though. It is simply a matter of trying your very best.

Being vegan, to me, is very much within the realm of what we can easily do, because all it constitutes is avoiding certain aisles at the grocery store. I understand that it does generally mean cooking for yourself a lot more, but if I have made the change, I’m pretty much certain anyone can. It also, to me, makes sense because it recognizes that the very basic capacity to feel pain and will to live — something all animals share — inherently makes a creature deserving of a life free from pain.. Those rights are so invaluable, human or not. They are the most basic rights we all naturally have. And all I have to do is spend 20-30 minutes cooking a couple times a day, or 10 minutes cutting up fruit in the morning. How could I justify not doing that, when it is that simple?

I think what is important to recognize is that going vegan means changing your eating habits and attitude towards food every bit as much as it means changing what you eat. This is why I had trouble for so long, at least — but trust me that *changing* those things is all that’s hard, you just have to get over a hump. If you have time to order and wait for delivery, or go out to a restaurant to eat, you should have time to cook. There is a lot you can do to help yourself out — cut up vegetables and fruit in advance, or if you find you have time at some point, just make huge batches of things you can eat throughout the week. I keep like six jars of soup in my fridge. Try to find very simple recipes, if you can — there plenty out there — and just stick to your favourites. Curries, pastas, sandwiches and soups are all very easy to make. If you actually would personally like advice or recipes, you can PM me. Once you have figured out what works for you — and I am absolutely you will get there — your life should no more difficult than it is now.

Try to develop a new attitude towards your food: because it is free from something that goes against your values, and also extremely healthy for you, it is nourishing you, both body and soul. And it is extremely healthy for you. I will admit that I know less about the health benefits of veganism than I do about the ethical ones, but I do know that there is a plethora of studies that link animal products to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and a number of other illnesses.

I think it makes absolute sense when you think about it: we are primates; we share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. Of course our bodies want a diet that’s mostly fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds. All animal products contain cholesterol. Not one plant contains cholesterol. Cholesterol literally *only* does your body harm — no good. All plants are high in fibre, and not one animal contains any fibre. A really wide study (that I desperately tried to find, to no avail) just found that less than 3% of meat-eating Americans get the recommended *minimum* amount of fiber in a day: 97% of the population is deficient. This was a huge profile of vegetarians (i.e. vegans) vs. non-vegetarians documenting a wide range of nutrients … I am pretty sure it was by Dr. Michael Greger and I can absolutely track it down if you’d like. It additionally found that vegetarians, on average, got 70% more protein than they need every day (along with meat-eaters). I am surprised that you found you are not getting enough protein, even for an athlete — what tipped you off to that? Getting enough protein usually just means is eating enough food in a day — it is so abundantly available. Have you ever seen the film Forks Over Knives? It’s on Netflix, and is completely about the health aspects of vegan vs. non-vegan diets. It’s a really good watch if you can get it.

I don’t know that a causal link has ever been established between meat and cancer, but I know that there are thousands upon *thousands* that demonstrate a definite connection. The same goes for both dairy and eggs. I believe that it has something to do with the fact that all animal products are acidic, and our bodies are alkaline. Acidic environments, I believe, are at a much higher risk of developing *and* of exacerbating cancer. Don’t quote me on that, though. I do know that vegans have consistently been shown to be at a very low risk.

I’m sorry that this was so incredibly long, but I really wanted to address each of your points in depth. I hope you take them into consideration. It is so good, once you’re on the other side of the fence.

P.S. Where the heck are your friends taking you that there are no options that can, at the very least, be modified to be vegan?!

Fahrenheit was a very poorly-designed scale. Fahrenheit was created with the intent being "OK, so 0 is the coldest it's ever been around here—about as cold as this brine mixture I made to represent it—and the human body is naturally at 100. OK, based on that scale, water freezes at 32 and boils at 212, interesting... that'll probably be easier to replicate than human body temperature." It turned out his brine wasn't fully mixed and would stabilize at -3°, so eventually they had to recalibrate this based on water's freezing point instead. It reeks of bad craft, but he was the guy who invented the mercury thermometer, so that's why it caught on.

Celsius, on the other hand, was created with the intent being "0° is freezing, 100° is boiling, and both of these measurements are at one atmosphere of pressure." Fahrenheit never had that last part until it got a specific definition in relation to Celsius. It's a much better-designed standard that was much easier to accurately replicate.

Kelvin? Lord Kelvin calculated what absolute zero would be in Celsius and then recalibrated that as zero. The conversion is easier—mere subtraction, as opposed to a Fahrenheit conversion's three-operation conversion—but more importantly, *a degree Celsius and a degree Kelvin have the same magnitude.* They are compatible! That's really useful!

But you want to bring usefulness into it? OK. Fahrenheit is probably the slightly better perceptual meteorological scale, I'll give you that. (Is it significantly better? Not really. 0° to 100° Fahrenheit is roughly analogous to -20° to 40° Celsius.) But is it better than Celsius at cooking temperatures? Not really. Celsius' perceptual definitions are at round numbers, too, which is helpful. And even if you just say "have a second system for scientific temperature measurements," compatibility is really useful—would you really want to have to buy custom thermometers or do clunky conversions just to be able to use your measurements with common scientific formulas? And it's better-designed, which made it easier to manufacture accurately at the time. Frankly, even as someone who uses Fahrenheit every day, I'm glad Celsius got the nod from the SI.
ERROR:
For daily outside temperatures, can you honestly say "0° to 100°, 32° is the threshold for if it'll snow" is really better than "-20° to 40°, 0° is the threshold for if it'll snow?"

I couldn't, in good conscience, argue that the Fahrenheit scale is *worse* for that one specific function if viewed in a vacuum... but I can't see any viable arguments (outside of familiarity) that it's *better* for that one specific function, either.

At that point, isn't familiarity with SI units—a general understanding that science and scientific measurements are the way we quantify the world around us, rather than turning science into this weird unfamiliar "other"—a concrete benefit?

I think we should be referring to "Germany" as "Deutschland". Why does a country need multiple proper names for different speakers? I understand that names need to be given English approximations when they use different characters in their language (for example, "Nippon" instead of "にっぽん"). But why do we get to just decide what another sovereign country should be called? It's their call.

It's like traveling somewhere and telling someone your name and they say:

*"Nah, I'm going to call you 'burblegonk' instead."* 

*"But... those sounds are my name. I just have the one name."* 

*"Not anymore, burblegonk."*

*"But you can pronounce my name just fine!"*

*"Yeah. I like burblegonk."*

"Germany" and "Japan" and "Bombay" should be considered slang non-official terms for those places.

Of course, but there is a difference between saying, “Hey, nice ass.” and “You look really pretty today.”  or “I really like what you’ve done with your hair.”

One comes across as sincere, and the other explicitly sexual and probably overtly aggressive. And as an adult, you have to keep in mind the person you’re interacting with, even if socially and outside of work, is still someone you have to work with on a daily basis.

In the U.S., unpasteurized milk is illegal or restricted in most states. This is also true in much of Europe—though the Germans and French are more lax (probably because of their wonderful raw milk cheeses)—and in Canada and Australia. I'm American and I choose to ignore these laws and buy raw milk and raw milk cheese from a private buying club. I love dairy products and it's impossible mimic the taste of raw milk. Though I believe that food safety restrictions are important to consumer safety, I feel that milk buyers who have been adequately warned of the risks should be able to purchase raw milk for the following reasons:

1. Regardless of the safety of raw milk, adults are generally considered responsible enough to buy awesome-but-potentially-dangerous substances like alcohol, junk food, and (increasingly) marijuana.

1. We know the risks. Farms that sell raw milk tend to go out of their way to inform consumers of the potential hazards. People who love raw milk enough to buy it on the black market invariably know what they're getting into. If it becomes legal, labeling legislation could be passed. Germany has done so successfully.

3. The penalties for selling raw milk are harsh and unnecessary. Farmers have been imprisoned for selling it. (Slightly irrelevant, I work with criminal justice clients as a social worker and have seen child predators get probation with no prison time.)

Please note that I'm *not* arguing that raw milk is perfectly safe or that everyone should drink it. I'm arguing that I should be able to decide whether I take that risk.

**EDIT:** Someone seems to be going through my posts and downvoting all of them. Can you not? This is CMV. I'm not trying to terrorize your children with my raw milk diseases. I'm trying to learn. Thanks to everyone who provided helpful info—this is why I keep coming to this sub!

**EDIT 2:** Copying one of my comments below. Although I might dispute the CDC's estimate of how much more dangerous raw milk is than other foods (see my other comments), and though I don't know if the risk of foodborne illness is enough to make me reconsider my occasional consumption of raw milk, I do acknowledge that diseases transmissible to other people can be contracted from raw milk in the modern era and that this could be a problem if more people start drinking raw milk. ∆ to /u/ionsquare for helpful links and excellent explanations.

&gt;•Human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask.

So does physics.

&gt;We don't consider people from those eras of those religions "evil," 

Depends, but sometimes we do.  Whether or not we say they are evil has nothing to do with whether they are actually evil, of course.

&gt;However, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect. It does not seem fair to call these people "evil" for doing what their culture does

To go back to the physics example, we wouldn't call people whose culture has a different physics model "stupid", even if they are incorrect.  That said, it's quite possible that the real moral answer is "It is moral to show respect to the dead, immoral to show disrespect to the dead, but what constitutes respect is culturally based".  

&gt;•Humans do not agree on moral issues. Euthanasia, abortion, and war are controversial issues. If morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues.

Humans do not agree on physics or even math.  Global warming, string theory, and even the Monty Hall problem are all controversial issues.  Math clearly shows that there is one answer to the Monty Hall problem, but even mathematicians don't actually all agree on it.  Math and science can be objective without people agreeing on these issues.

&gt;•Legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. This is why the law is not always right.

Sure, but this is a criticism of laws and not morality.

&gt;Therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world.

Well, it can't be translated perfectly into law, but that's different from not working.  Math can't be translated perfectly into a computer program, but math still works in the real world.

&gt;•Human morality often reflects evolution. (And evolution can be used to explain certain "objective" morals)

This is a "just so story" and is not actually justified by data.  Your specific examples here are likely incorrect (see The Selfish Gene for why they're problematic), but even if you picked more accurate examples, we still don't have any real evidence to show which attitudes are evolved and which aren't.  Let alone what benefits are "responsible" for the direction evolution has taken.

&gt;•To use an example from popular culture, the Formics from Ender's Game possess no free will on an individual level, and do not consider killing morally wrong. Humans hold free will and agency in high regard, yet the Formics do not, and even a seemingly objective moral rule, "Don't kill people," is not universal. 

There's certainly no shortage of disagreement on ethics, math, or any other subject.

&gt;However, as the author demonstrates, this does not make them evil

Not demonstrates.  Claims. 

&gt;This is not to say that I believe serial killers are just as moral as saints. It is clear that morals are necessary to the structure of society

Doesn't the fact that this is clear serve as evidence that some moral systems are actually better than others?  Can't we say that some moral standards/rules are more likely to be correct (or are correct in much more/broader situations) than others?

My partner wants to go to 'Gay Ski Week' in NZ. Unlike me, He’s never been skiing and knows nothing of the communities on the mountain. I asked him to convince me why we should attend Gay Ski Week as opposed to attending at any other time and his reply was "there'll be parties, " to which I replied "do you not think the straight community party?"  
  
I’ve never been an active member of the gay community. This is not because I am in any way opposed to it, but due to this belief in complete integration that I hold and the movements of the gay community, I find, conflict with this idea. I understand that many members of the gay community find comfort and safety in the presence of like-minded individuals, but I struggle to believe that the aforementioned segregated-safety in which they seek does nothing more than alienate them further from the rest of the community.  
  
Furthermore, I find this segregation perpetuates the idea that male homosexuals are promiscuous because it accentuates my entire argument above, summed up with "Why the need for a *gay* [event]? Are they all planning to fuck? [not quite as eloquent, but straight to the point]"
  
As I want my partner to enjoy his first ski trip, as well as myself, I would be open to the idea of going to the Gay Ski Week in NZ if I understood its purpose.

I believe that prostitution should not be legalized. Whether I morally agree with prostitution or not is not what matters here. The laws in the United States are set in order to protect the freedom, safety, and quality of life of the citizens (not willing to argue about this). Yes, the US has Freedom of Choice Act for all. And many try to use this to argue that prostitution should be legalized. One might say “it is their own decision how they live their life and they are not hurting anyone else.” However, the continuation of practicing prostitution IS hurting other people. In prostitution, human’s bodies are up for sale- similar to a toy that is up for sale in a mall. And, just like a toy at a mall, the object that these people are offering can be bought… or stolen. Objectifying a person like this unleashes the idea that, just like with any other object being sold, (although it is not right) stealing is an option. This leads to abuse and violence. But this violence does not only affect the one person that chose to sell his/her body! It dehumanizes all people by alienating sexuality from a person and therefore fuels human trafficking. Legalizing prostitution would just say that all of this objectification is “okay” and the world would only experience MORE of the violent, abusive results that it already currently receives from illegal prostitution. Just like the act of murder hurts other people, the act of prostitution hurts people by promoting human trafficking. We need prostitution to remain illegal in order to try to protect every innocent life, not make it more possible that an innocent life will be hurt.

Human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives. We are the most important people in our experience on earth, and our society works in an “every man for himself” manner. Even acts of immense kindness and charity are formulated with the person’s core understanding that they will feel good as a result of the positive actions that they’re taking. An example of such is as follows: If a father valiantly gives his life to transplant a vital organ into his dying son, even that act is inherently selfish. For that man made that sacrifice, of his son over himself, because he would not be able to bear to continue living life without his son. There is no counter example for this claim; all human actions are fundamentally selfish. Our evolution depends on survival of those most fit. It is how we have arrived at today and how we will get to tomorrow.

The punishment model hasn't worked up until now.  Recidivism rate for the general prison population is in the area of 75‰. If that is for adults,  what makes you think that public shaming and physical violence is going to work or serve any purpose on teenagers.  However there are processes that do work.  

One is called "restorative justice"  participants in a program meet with their victims.  The victims get a chance to speak about what the event felt like for them and the after effects,  then the perpetrators get a chance to speak.  That talk about what they were thinking at the time.  And how they feel now.  Then they have to make an off of how to restore the situation,  to make it right.  This program have been used with murderer's and the families of their victims and with rapists.  Strangely enough,  often the offer of restoration that the perpetrator make is seen as too harsh by the victim and the suggest a reduction in those consequences.  Not always,  but sometimes.  

The funny thing is,  I saw these methods used in a kindergarten when there were conflicts between children and have watched a video discussing their use with hardened criminals.  It doesn't always work,  but it has a much better outcome than the current model.  

On a bigger scale there is a process called justice re-investment.  A city looks at all the crime in the city and looks at the post code addresses where the majority of the perpetrators live.  Then they go into that area and simply ask.  "what do you need to stop committing crimes" often the answers are surprisingly simple.  "I sell drugs because I can't get a job because there is no one to look after my kids" child care centres are a Hell of a lot cheaper to run than prisons .  This process saved Austin Texas 60 million a year.  Simply by keeping people out of prison. 

Here in Australia,  kids are out on the street at night because cheap housing has no air conditioning and the housing is built in a way that it doesn't cool down at night.  So kids can't sleep.  So they wander and get into trouble or do graffiti.  

In the city of Chicago several years ago,  guys were doing drugs because they had no jobs and were bored.  So a guy set up a thing called  "midnight basketball"  he set up league and the games started at midnight.  Guys stopped doing drugs because they were playing on a team and the team needed them there and sober.  Don't know if it is still running but it worked.  And although expensive to run,  it still would have been cheaper than building prisons .  

The old testament model of "an eye for an eye"  just gives us a society full of blind people.  A real solution is to look for the causes of the problem and then fix them. 

I am cheap,  I only want to fix shit once.  Not keep fixing it over and over.

While I agree with most of the points you present, I really don't like the idea of encouraging teenagers.  
1. **Sex creates emotional bonds between people.** Even if the school is encouraging casual sex, that doesn't mean there isn't an emotional bond between people when they have sex. As discussed on another CMV, I think some people are meant for casual sex and some people aren't. And the people that aren't could be emotionally damaged by having casual sex.  
2. **Sex requires maturity.** Some people, whether they want it or not, aren't ready. I think health classes should definitely destigmatise sex and make sure even teens from middle school understand that sex is a natural/normal thing. But some people at that age will still be immature about it.  
3. **So much drama.** This is also partly to do with my point on maturity. If immature people are having sex and being super open about it, even you have to admit that there's going to be a lot of shaming and bullying (in today's culture). I could see a lot of these quotes going around schools:  
"Her vagina looks weird"  
"He lasted 2 seconds"  
"She has pepperoni tits"  
"He has a small penis"  
"She queefed omg how weird"  
Teenagers would spread so many rumours. 
  
When people understand that all body types are normal and are mature enough to use the sex to get to know themselves better without becoming emotionally attached or spread rumors or shame people that have decided not to have sex, then *maybe* I could support this. But otherwise most teenagers would be too judgemental or immature to do this.  
This isn't to say I think teenagers shouldn't  have sex. If they feel they're ready that's great, and destigmatising it is the first step. But when the school system encourages them to have casual sex, it gets weird. These are some things I am going to write but am too lazy to make arguments for.  
  
What happens when teens don't have safe sex even when the school is encouraging it? This goes against what a lot of religions value. Parents probably don't want their son/daughter having sex. Would the school be sued if someone gets a permanent STD after having sex because the school encouraged it and a condom broke or something similar? This could backfire and cause them to have less sex (ex: omg my weird teacher is telling me to have sex, sex must be really weird.) Also would teachers telling students to have sex be sexual harassment? It seems like it's similar even if it's not.

What I am referring to when I say modernity is the political, social and economic order which rose to prominence after the European enlightenment. Its features include the global rise of liberalism, colonialism, and capitalism. My argument is in line with the works of Eric Williams (read: capitalism and slavery) and Aimé Césaire (discourse on colonialism). Both works are easily googlable. 

The rise of modernity, we are told, was synonymous with the 'civilizing' of the world, laying the foundation for the great and good modern nation states. On the contrary, the project of modernity was so suffused with barbarism that it couldn't possibly be so. We frequently underestimate how foundational slavery was to the construction of the modern era; if anything, it was modernity which 'barbarized' (barbarianised?) the world. 


Slavery was at the core of modern colonial expansion; there was no work done during this period that did not rely on regimes of unfree labour to render cheap commodities available for the global market. Whether it was sugar, spices, gold, silver, iron goods, molasses, rum or any other commodity you can think of, there is a link to the economic institution of forced unfree labour (what we call 'slavery'). The above commodities were traded for people in western Africa, alongside iron goods (chains, manacles, locks, guns, ammo, gunpowder etc) and were used to collect more captives to sell. These captives were then forced through the 'middle passage' to America. Once there, the captives would be sold and traded for raw materials which were transported back to the mother country (until American independence, when they started exporting their own manufactured goods. Again bolstered by unfree labour.) For more information on this process, google 'triangular trade'. 

Entire cities were born and grew fat on the trade in slaves: London, Glasgow, Liverpool were all built as manufacturing centres for slave-labour raw materials like sugar cane, cotton and raw minerals. Entire nations grew fat on the trade in slaves (I'm looking at you, Canada, U.S, Australia, New Zealand etc etc etc). Science, also modernity's child, is not exempt. Entire fields of 'science' were created to justify these racialized social hierarchies: the most common example being phrenology, but there were plenty more. (For more information, google "Human Zoos"). 
Many modern financial institutions had their start in the slave trade, including banks (Lloyds, Barclays), insurance companies and financial speculators.

Not only was slavery a contingent aspect of modern capitalism, but so was theft. Entire nations of people were displaced through genocide, rape and other forms of violent coercion (Chapter 1 of Zinn's 'A People's History of the United States' is a good starting reader there). Columbus and Cortez,(not to mention Washington and MacDonald a century or two later) enacted the genocide of millions of people simply by virtue of having better weapons, sharper tactics (cause, y'know, the crusades made people pretty hard) and biological warfare. These technologies were all deployed to steal land and resources from sovereign nations. It's like the dark lord Sauron washed up on the isle of Hispaniola and decided to create 'New Mordor'. There is nothing laudable about the processes which built up modern nation states, and the continuing effects of that constitutive violence undermine Liberalism's claims to equality. 

Life may not have been perfect for indigenous peoples of the Americas, but we can safely say that a 'peasant' living in Inca or Aztec territory probably had a better quality of life than a European of a similar class. Corn (which btw was created by the agricultural ingenuity of Indigenous south Americans and is still considered the most influential act of bioengineering in human history) made it possible to feed millions of people. Alongside tomatoes, potatoes, squash, and beans of various kinds, there was no need for animal protein. Thus, indigenous south Americans were not exposed to diseases like smallpox, which are a direct result of farming animals. Also, many indigenous cultures operated with a form of democracy (or federational government-like structures) where individual rights were manifest, though they were not articulated with the language of Liberalism. 

Speaking of the contemporary period, very little has changed. Global capitalism still rules the day with an iron fist; neoliberal financial institutions oversee the creation of export-centred economies in poor states which are unable to meet the demands of their populace. The populace, desperate, must migrate to find markets that they can usefully engage in. Temporary foreign worker programs in rich states (like Canada) are happy to take them in, benefit from the economic surplus they create while keeping wages criminally low and barring permanent residency. (Google 'Harsha Walia' for details of this process in the Canadian context). This is barely better than slavery, which also served to keep the price of commodities down for global production. 

TL:DR Slavery may have existed before capitalism, but capitalism wouldn't have been born without slavery. Although the tools are slightly different now, the logic of capitalism/modernity remains similar to its terrifyingly evil roots. It is based on the enslavement, alienation and displacement of indigenous peoples from their traditional lands and resources. As such, there is no morally tenable argument in favour of modernity. 

Edit: /u/nevrin has changed my view. The premise of good v. evil is a weak one. Rather than "Modernity is Evil" I ought to have said something like: We, as the beneficiaries of modernity, ought to immediately cease the valorization of western liberal norms based on the violence with which they have always been concomitant. We ought to reconceptualize and revitalize our notions of rights by engaging with Indigenous epistimologies, which themselves are continually supressed within the current dominant order.

In other words, we have a lot to learn from our suppressed past. We already need to change things drastically if we (humans and ecosystems) are going to survive this century.

What does having a default mean? If you make it yourself, cream and sugar are not just automatically added. You do have to make the conscious decision to actually add them. If you go to a coffee shop, usually they ask you if you want room for milk, which seems reasonable.      
        
There isn't really an argument here. Additives aren't really assumed and there really isn't a stigma against people who drink black coffee. A grand total of nobody care about you take your coffee.

If time is infinite, then all possibilities have already happened an infinite number of times, therefore meaning that my consciousness will have "repeated" an infinite number of times.     
     
However, you can't just assume time is infinite. It could have had a starting point, and just because we don't know if there is an end point doesn't mean there isn't one. "Time is infinite" is not some universal law, just a theory. You cannot just assume that. 
ERROR:
You're not looking at the long game. Sure, casting a blank vote in an upcoming election does diddly squat – right then and there.

However, if blank votes are counted, and a significant portion of the electorate essentially say "I am willing to vote, but you guys are all terrible", existing parties will have an incentive to figure out what those voters want, and change their policies. Or, it tells people that there is potential for new parties to gain influence, paving the way for more competition.

In the short term, blank votes don't do much. Over the course of a couple of election cycles it can do a lot. 

I can promise you that if more than 10% of the Danish electorate were to vote blank in the next election, it'd be a political earthquake. Something like [0.5%](http://www.dst.dk/valg/Valg1204271/valgopg/valgopgHL.htm) did it the last time, so there's not really a whole lot to swing at the moment.
ERROR:
I doubt that would ever happen. However, if it did, it would be an unprecedented event. I think that would stand up to your original viewpoint – there *is* a difference between casting a blank vote and not voting at all, but only if enough people do it.

In other words, the amount of disapproval and mistrust must pass a certain threshold for it to be relevant.
ERROR:
I think this might be a case of semantics and in my experience that makes is somewhat subjective.    
My favorite mental exercise exploring semantics is to consider the question from a different latitude, longitude, or time. 
 
You used Newton as an example, if you were to travel back and time and tell Newton you were a Scientist or he was a Scientist, I think he would be puzzled and likely consider himself an alchemist or philosopher.  

If you were to travel to Germany and declare Bill Nye to be a Wissenschaftler, which I take is the closest equivalent concept to Scientist, they would probably agree with you as it's a bit of a different concept.    

"Is Bill Nye someone who practices the Scientific Method researching Natural Phenomena" I would say nope, I don't think so though I don't follow him around so I can't be sure.    
If you asked me if Bill Nye is a Scientist then I would say yes I think so. He's definitely a science guy and first to come to mind when it comes to propagating the scientific method. Also other reasons.

It just feels to me like if your concept relies on someone standing in a certain place (North America) at a certain time (21st century) in a certain language (English) then it has some wiggle room or you need to fully outline a concept with hard lines and where to draw them instead of just using one word, and I think most people will agree whether your definition applies. (Just not the original word)

Also I while I'm inclined to agree with you regarding Scientist vs Engineer, 
My Title is Engineer, my Degree is Computer Science... so I always thought of it as a branch of Science.... but would never call myself a Scientist.  Also I typically think of computer programming, particularly test driven development, as the Scientific method testing theories.

I’ve simply never seen the point in drinking. I’ve been to a few stereotypical high school parties where people have asked me why I don’t drink on several occasions. I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I’m not religious, can’t dismiss it due to taste (although I’ve heard it’s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as “I just don’t drink”, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of “I don’t want to become like you” after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I’ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don’t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I’ve yet to attend one of these uni events. 

Not that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. “Oh, you’re drinking *that*?”, “this wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste”, to which I can only roll my eyes.

I also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.

At the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I’ll never be able to experience later on. I’m torn on the issue – on the one hand I want to be more *normal*, on the other hand I take pride in having stood up to peer-pressure for so many years and practiced a fair amount of  self-discipline. Please CMV.

**Edit** Wow, thanks for all the responses! Lots to read and think about – I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.

**Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.

**Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though. Will instead invite very close childhood friends for a night of cooking, board games and drinking (baby steps). You guys have been stressing drinking in moderation, so if anyone would provide more detailed insight into that I'd be grateful (I'm 6", 135 lbs if that's of any assistance). Also tips on what to drink/mix for a total newbie would be great. Deltas will be awarded in due time, gotta catch some Zs first.

I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I’m not religious, can’t dismiss it due to taste (although I’ve heard it’s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as “I just don’t drink”, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of “I don’t want to become like you” after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I’ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don’t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I’ve yet to attend one of these uni events. 

Not that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. “Oh, you’re drinking *that*?”, “this wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste”, to which I can only roll my eyes.

I also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.

At the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I’ll never be able to experience later on. I’m torn on the issue – on the one hand I want to be more *normal*, on the other hand I take pride in having stood up to peer-pressure for so many years and practiced a fair amount of  self-discipline. Please CMV.

**Edit** Wow, thanks for all the responses! Lots to read and think about – I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.

**Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.

**Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though. Will instead invite very close childhood friends for a night of cooking, board games and drinking (baby steps). You guys have been stressing drinking in moderation, so if anyone would provide more detailed insight into that I'd be grateful (I'm 6", 135 lbs if that's of any assistance). Also tips on what to drink/mix for a total newbie would be great. Deltas will be awarded in due time, gotta catch some Zs first.

I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I’m not religious, can’t dismiss it due to taste (although I’ve heard it’s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as “I just don’t drink”, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of “I don’t want to become like you” after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I’ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don’t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I’ve yet to attend one of these uni events. 

Not that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. “Oh, you’re drinking *that*?”, “this wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste”, to which I can only roll my eyes.

I also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.

At the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I’ll never be able to experience later on. I’m torn on the issue – on the one hand I want to be more *normal*, on the other hand I take pride in having stood up to peer-pressure for so many years and practiced a fair amount of  self-discipline. Please CMV.

**Edit** Wow, thanks for all the responses! Lots to read and think about – I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.

**Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.

**Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though. Will instead invite very close childhood friends for a night of cooking, board games and drinking (baby steps). You guys have been stressing drinking in moderation, so if anyone would provide more detailed insight into that I'd be grateful (I'm 6", 135 lbs if that's of any assistance). Also tips on what to drink/mix for a total newbie would be great. Deltas will be awarded in due time, gotta catch some Zs first.
