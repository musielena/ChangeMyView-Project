t3_2mptvb,cm6q0wq,"I think guys are told that girls need emotional connection and something serious. I know men who tried to ""play"" girls by telling them they love them even when the girls in question told them directly they can't possibly love them yet, they don't need to hear that shit, and they are fine with just hanging out. But many men think that a good girl just looks for someone to marry."
t3_2lhzxl,cluy5d5,"The rich side pays lots for representation, but can still find better lawyers because they have a lot more time on their side, and a lot more contacts that would allow them to know the best lawyers. You're always going to get an imbalance of rich vs poor, even when doing something like this. I can see this going at least two ways: 1."
t3_2fkhgs,ckahr81,"Also there are cases where I do default to the English version of the word - a consequence of being born in the US and only having received education in English. For example Colorado Montana and Florida are all Spanish words, but when referring to the States I always default to the English version - often even when speaking in Spanish, which feels strange each time because I become aware of how in saying it since it sounds out of place to me. I natively default to both versions in different contexts."
t3_2fgw85,ck9ihil,"Therefore, it would seem that enjoyment is one reason to live life. What about reasons to live even when you aren't happy? I think you touched on one of the important ones in your OP."
t3_2e1fah,cjwh2ek,"As someone who has always owned vehicles and never used public transit, my cars only cost me about $100/mo, $300/mo when I had a car payment. $580/mo, even when taking into consideration the initial purchase price of the vehicle, seems steep to me. Plus even if you were saving $300/mo or so on transportation, it still doesn't compensate for the increase in the cost of housing."
t3_2dsh9z,cjsprfv,"Same theory as a protest, but in a very positive way. It empowers family &amp; friends to do something, even when said disease has no cure. Raising X$ thousand dollars, as an ""ordinary"" family/rider/team, feels very good."
t3_2ck1p9,cjg9ik8,"Hell, to by knowledge we never even see Wayne Enterprises selling Batman toys or action figures. Hell, even when Wayne Enterprises unveils Batman Incorporated, they're never making money off of the agents of BI. Batman has given numerous more plausible rationalizations for why he doesn't kill, including a number of strictly consequentialist arguments (as well as several based on duty or virtue, too)."
t3_2c6m3v,cjcrw0m,"We don;t actually know how to teach generalized critical thinking skills, so the first half of what you're proposing doesn't have any utility. We can teach critical thinking about history, critical thinking about literature,, critical thinking about politics etc, but they are all separates subjects, even when they use identical skills, because people do not apply critical thinking skills except in the subject alongside which they learned them. (This is how you get brilliant physicists and chemists claiming batshit insane stuff about other subjects)."
t3_2bamw2,cj4efyq,"We just don't do that for all of our domesticated animals. In any event, it is true that even when domesticated animals are not mistreated, perhaps they would have been better off never having been born, than to live their lives as our property, to eventually be eaten. The good part is, they don't really fear the future or think about it to any great extent."
t3_2a49tn,circrlo,"There was a bill to try and ban prospective employers from having access to that information, but given our current political climate, if it's not renaming a post office, it's probably not getting through congress. A big problem of minimum wage jobs is that regardless of how someone may have ended up working one, they rarely pay enough to actually feed yourself or pay rent, which becomes even more impossible if you have a family to feed, even when you're working 2 neither of which gives you a full 40 hours so they don't have to give you benefits. Eventually working 2 of almost 40 hours a week at min wage with mouths to feed but don't make enough to do so a lot of people go on welfare."
t3_2a299i,ciqt0e3,"URL dedicated to coming up with reasonable (-sounding), ration (-sounding) policy statements to win over the common man to the ideals of conservatism. The left is only recently (in the past decade or so) really catching up URL Just be aware that if you go this route - trying to change the Democratic party - you'll probably have to support current Democrats even when they're being less than optimal in their support for policies that get their constituents revved up. Clinton and his URL tried to go the other way: make the Democratic party successful by being conservative but with a ""heart"" and/or not as much blatant Old White Male Favoritism as was in the Republicans."
t3_29n4wo,cimnxth,"Even highly successful and good people have setbacks in life and bad aspects to their personality. If you want someone in your life who will accept you, bad parts included, even when you have failures and setbacks, then you need to be prepared to do the same for them. "
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"Depression doesn't mean you're sad ALL the time, but it does make everything a struggle 2\. They want to seem like they're okay even when they're not. Personally, I don't have many friends, and almost all of them are very close."
t3_26nayb,chsv92t,"Hating one woman doesn't make you misogynist. If it is more difficult for a woman to gain your trust than it is for a man to do so, even when you not sexually interested in either party, it looks bad. Recognizing that there may be a problem is the first step to fixing it however."
t3_26avz4,chpkmh2,"1. Filled with fruit, which is yummy and reasonably healthy even when sweetened and put into stollen. 2."
t3_21bodq,cgc0utx,"Also as a side note, did this come up from listening to NPR this afternoon? I've got a couple reasons it may still be important even when he gets to be older. First of all, standardized tests, AP exams, and many run-of-the-mill English papers will still be required to be handwritten even in 15 years unless truly drastic reform occurs."
t3_20i4lp,cgc72jk,"It impacts decisions to go to war, to surrender, to placate... The facts and estimates of risk are part of the decision, but even when those facts are known, a value-judgment must be made based on those facts. "
t3_1twxa7,cecflca,"The degree of awareness per individual mind play into the degree of influence of media. It influences, even when it's as simple as a food advert, or a thought of opinion upon an event. A suggestion here, an attribution there, just like people you talk with have that ability."
t3_1tpqhr,ceaei9g,"Going to private ownership of the highways wouldn't introduce genuine competition any more than privatizing water systems would give you any real choice as to who you pay for water. And as we've seen with the telecommunications industry, private companies in such an advantageous position are extremely reluctant to spend money on maintaining and upgrading their infrastructure, even when the government DOES offer to subsidize it. A bridge that's in danger of collapse when under heavy traffic conditions isn't going to be repaired or replaced if it's privatized, it'll just have the toll cranked higher and higher instead."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"Well, it's far harder to detect such a strategy but again, this runs into huge issues with an uncooperative player. In fact, you will force their score to be 2 even when they are always defecting, meaning you will get a pitiful score. This is obviously a poor choice."
t3_1kmwmn,cbqlofq,"This is actually two different issues, so I'll address both of them. ""increased permissiveness of the dominant philosophy"" is not only more of a liberal thing than a conservative one, this is actually true even when liberals are not dominant. Studies have shown that leftist/liberals are much less open to tolerating other ideologies, or allowing people with those to get ahead than conservatives are."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"Thus, even though I agree that animals don't have rights because we have no reason to restrict ourselves in our dealings with them, in certain cases it is still in our self-interest to not treat them poorly - not out of consideration for them, but out of consideration for ourselves. Specifically, though factory farming and such are fine even when they cause animal suffering, it is because the suffering isn't the goal but an undesirable yet acceptable side effect of the real goal, which is relatively inexpensive food. But if causing animals to suffer was someone's actual goal, such as someone who would kick puppies for the fun of it, that would promote sociopathic behavior, and shouldn't be done."
t3_1hxzas,caz1z09,I preferred spending my school lunches reading books than running around playing sports. I did my hardest to excel academically even when it mattered little. I preferred keeping to a small group of friends than socializing with anyone who did so little as meet eye contact with me.
t3_1hxrtn,cayzct9,Because they enjoy being there or because they think it'll benefit them. They have every right to do so even when it'll damage their health. Working in a mine and most foundries will damage your health and there is nothing barbaric about that.
t3_1dj741,c9qu7yd,"Check out China: the country is so vast that the same language ended up segmenting into different versions. These versions developed into almost-different languages, even when the base alphabet is the same. Languages adapt around regions and cultures."
t3_1cmux5,c9i323k,EDIT: Here's a relevant bit from the last chapter of Bertrand Russell's URL : There seems to be a fair amount of users here who will post a rebuttal to the OP's opinion even when they agree with the OP's stance personally. The spirit of this subreddit seems to be in favor of presenting all sides of a subject as opposed to just assuming one's stance is self evident.
t3_1bwu2v,c9auie0,"One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children. In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed. I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids."
t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"You only start paying income tax when you cross the £10k boundary. You do, however, IIRC pay NI contributions even when you are under the £10k mark. This is a game British politicians love to play, they make all sorts of promises about income tax while conveniently forgetting that people also pay NI contributions which, in a way, act as a second income tax."
t3_32lp3g,cqckmii,"So they are pointing out at least one notable inequality by calling attention to it. You may not think this is an important issue to address, but women are judged on their comeliness anytime they walk out the door, and a lack of clothing, or even certain clothing, automatically assumes they are being sexual even when they aren't. We get uppity when we see women being forced to wear URL in the middle east, but there isn't a lot of difference between ""You can't wear anything but this because you're not a man"" and ""You can't wear these because you're not a man""."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"Because sometime people are wrong, and are behaving immorally without knowing it. That doesn't make them evil, but behaving imoraly is wrong, even when you don't know it is. "
t3_2t6ote,cnw9vyp,"So they go to virtual storage facilities with ""guardians"" who are more guard than parent. Faced with that choice the system often prefers to keep kids with parents even when they are screwy and so really doesn't do much. That said... We need some kind of system to activate in the worst cases and CPS generally does a its job there."
