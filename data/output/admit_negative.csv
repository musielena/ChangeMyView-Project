t3_2o2kga,cmj4j7t,"These seem like the words of someone who is able to think clearly and reason what the future implications will be if she stays with the guy that night. Now I will admit the line of ""Say, what's in this drink"" could be seem as concerning, but prior to that she talks about having half a drink more. So they were both already drinking."
t3_2mqzo8,cm6vifg,"And if you aren't going to a high end college, well then its not near as expensive (sticker price). I admit I was not totally clear with the generational wealth thing. So, for example, there were various government programs which helped whites buy houses in suburbia, post-WW2."
t3_2lvano,clyhfb1,"writing a letter), it's extremely difficult to successfully gauge whether the physical space available will perfectly match what you eventually write and whether it will ultimately look as neat as possible. Now (and I admit this is subjective), I'd consider a letter that has uneven spacing to be less neat than a letter where perfect columns are maintained throughout and hyphens are used to complete words exceeding the available column space. It does sometimes create a mental pause when read, but it still often looks more professional and more coherent than an item where words are squeezed into tight margins or written out fully in spite of the margins."
t3_2ixatz,cl6g9da,"Remember without a star in proximity the temperature would constantly be dropping. At this point let's bring back in my first reason- we haven't yet found any evidence that intelligent life exists anywhere but here on earth so the likely hood of any aliens coming from a nearby star is incredibly low, otherwise we would have seen evidence of their existence before now- though I do admit it's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, the same odds are against the hopeful invaders. So to sum up- What would be the point of travelling an enormous distance and consuming an enormous amount of resource to come and kill us- to steal our resource?"
t3_2ah6lr,civ4716,"As others have pointed out, people like me that check in at TiA acknowledge the underlying issues that concern the tumblerinas that we find. I'll be the first to admit that this world has work to do. However, the abject disconnect with reality espoused on certain tumblr blogs actually hinders progress."
t3_20v70n,cg73vfe,"I agree with you that there are a lot of situations where lying causes confusion, and I agree that those are times where it might be better to tell the truth. But I think you have to admit that sometimes lies are better than truths. "
t3_20ofb2,cg5kvls,"I'm also curious about the differences between public and private schools there? Perhaps not all bullies have been physically abused at home and I admit that a lot of kids, like a lot of adults, are in fact jerks. I'm sure every person can recall being a jerk at some point in their childhood - because kids are still developing their sense of morality."
t3_1zj8xe,cfuptvj,"I would predict that that school would lose considerable prestige. I have to admit I'm skeptical about this. It would be kind of lame to call out a specific professor or school, but I'm genuinely interested in what kinds of classes you're taking and how often this is such a big issue."
t3_1z1xc4,cfprwpl,"Imagine there were a little person living inside you, but you did not invite him there. If it is a full person, as you suggest and I admit for the purpose of this discussion, then this little person has a right to live. But that does not necessarily imply that you as the other affected party is under any obligation to host the uninvited little person inside your body at great risk to yourself."
t3_1wh80m,cf2a6xq,is internalized sexist notions in our society. Okay I'll admit I was shocked to not see this post as a misogynist jumble blaming women for all their supposed women's-problems and therefore sexism doesn't exist. Awesome!
t3_1ptfoy,cd65x34,"All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong. yep i caricatured you, i knew that i was caricaturing your viewpoint when i did it, don't worry I admit it. All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong."
t3_1orrrs,ccv4ank,I work with very low income families as a legal services attorney. I admit I often wonder why people don't wait until they can afford children to have them. I think part of the answer is that many of these people don't foresee a time when they will be better off.
t3_1oj3p9,ccsf2i1,"URL 3. URL (Although I admit this one is very politicized, so feel free to ignore it if you don't feel it is good to you personally). 4."
t3_1g05un,cafhkpm,"You stated in your ""edit"" that video games are art, but you do not consider gamers to be ""artists"". I think you have to admit that gaming is artistic expression though, if you also believe that enjoying the art forms I mentioned above counts as expression. "

t3_306b19,cpqv22p,"The idea I've had explained to me is that if we stop things that are outputting CO2 such as using our oil fuelled vehicles, which produce 19 pounds of CO2 per liter of gas used while driving according to URL we have a chance of stopping the increase in temperatures before the positive feedback loops become uncontrollable. I admit it is pretty hard to find good numbers to describe exactly how much CO2's put out by people driving, and studies show up with different numbers, but scientists appear to agree that it's a lot, and probably not a good idea to keep doing it. Another idea is that we do things that could absorb CO2 back into the earth, by doing things such as planting a lot of trees."
t3_2u460b,co5wbvc,"So yeah, trigger warnings should really only be reserved for those who have had traumatic experiences. Because now I can't even admit my triggers without people mocking me or looking at me funny, which sucks. "
