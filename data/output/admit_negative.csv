t3_2q9fkx,cn4ebjb,"A more sensible calendar might be, like, a little better, but how much? Most people don't spend a lot of time doing the kind of calendar arithmetic that would be alleviated by moving to a slightly more intuitive calendar - which, as you admit yourself, still wouldn't be perfect since a full year is 365.24998798765 days long, or whatever the number is. If a calendar must be imperfect due to the very nature of the thing it's measuring, why would we want to change to a new one?"
t3_2pimzj,cmy635r,"For the majority of the time, I felt right, but my doubt was slowly rising. I would argue or ignore, but each time I argued, or saw a joke challenging my beliefs or looked into another one, those arguments stuck better and better, til eventually years later I admitted it didnt really make sense to me. My point is, while they may not be looking to change their opinions in one argument or may seem combative, you may very well still leave an impression on them or at least let them challenge their beliefs."
t3_2o2kga,cmj4j7t,"These seem like the words of someone who is able to think clearly and reason what the future implications will be if she stays with the guy that night. Now I will admit the line of ""Say, what's in this drink"" could be seem as concerning, but prior to that she talks about having half a drink more. So they were both already drinking."
t3_2njpov,cme7zu7,"A many of the witnesses seem to have very contradictory statements (3 state he was kneeling and running while being shot at while another 3 state he charged him while being shot at with his hands up?) The credibility of some witnesses came into question when it came out that a few of them: ""...admitted the they had not seen the shooting or only part of the shooting, or were simply repeating the stories they have heard,"" All in all its not so unbelievable that based on the evidence shown to the jury that they came to the conclusion that it is more likely that it was lawful than a murder. "
t3_2mqzo8,cm6vifg,"And if you aren't going to a high end college, well then its not near as expensive (sticker price). I admit I was not totally clear with the generational wealth thing. So, for example, there were various government programs which helped whites buy houses in suburbia, post-WW2."
t3_2lvano,clyhfb1,"writing a letter), it's extremely difficult to successfully gauge whether the physical space available will perfectly match what you eventually write and whether it will ultimately look as neat as possible. Now (and I admit this is subjective), I'd consider a letter that has uneven spacing to be less neat than a letter where perfect columns are maintained throughout and hyphens are used to complete words exceeding the available column space. It does sometimes create a mental pause when read, but it still often looks more professional and more coherent than an item where words are squeezed into tight margins or written out fully in spite of the margins."
t3_2lqmp9,clxmady,"I'm actually really surprised nobody here seems to have mentioned that yet. We can admit that the Nazi imagery and propaganda were remarkably effective without agreeing with their goals or methods. That's why Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (a ground-breaking Nazi propaganda film) is still so widely praised, mimicked, and studied even while its message is rejected."
t3_2j7xhu,cl96t4g,"For example, greatapes subreddit is dedicated to hating ethnic minorities. Secondly, while I'm admittedly not an expert, there does seem to be a connotation of hate speech being directed at a member of a protected class - which I'm pretty sure that television show preference is not. "
t3_2ixatz,cl6g9da,"Remember without a star in proximity the temperature would constantly be dropping. At this point let's bring back in my first reason- we haven't yet found any evidence that intelligent life exists anywhere but here on earth so the likely hood of any aliens coming from a nearby star is incredibly low, otherwise we would have seen evidence of their existence before now- though I do admit it's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, the same odds are against the hopeful invaders. So to sum up- What would be the point of travelling an enormous distance and consuming an enormous amount of resource to come and kill us- to steal our resource?"
t3_2i6sq2,ckzpzfm,"I disagree that singling out feminists isn't warranted though. In the case what we're talking about here is a large, international effort to inject feminist ideology into Wikipedia at large, which is in fact a direct threat to it's objectivity, and in some cases reliability due to articles being removed (Thomas James Ball comes to mind, which admittedly predates this academia infiltration). More importantly, this was not the actions of a few isolated radical feminists, but was instead a large-scale effort by academic feminists on an international scale, including the gender studies departments at multiple Ivy League universitites in the US."
t3_2hfggr,cks5dxq,"The biggest thing would be why you aren't attracted to a black person, white person, etc? I think you are kidding yourself if you don't think that media and society influences what you find attractive, and it most certainly influences what you admit to finding attractive. An example I am more aware of is in the US at least a lot of men have ""yellow fever."""
t3_2glozx,ckkcrue,"But what if it's the same hot sauce? Now you have the awkward situation of admitting that it feels the same to both of us, but one of us likes it and the other doesn't. Or what about masochists, cutters, etc?"
t3_2e4b5f,cjwigez,"If you believe that strongly in justice, I will PM you the names of all the people accused of crimes in my area so you can make the world right with your internet lynch mob. So you are saying that you would willingly put a cop and their family in danger just so that cop would admit to guilt (whether or not they believed they were guilty). If you believe that strongly in justice, I will PM you the names of all the people accused of crimes in my area so you can make the world right with your internet lynch mob."
t3_2e3t22,cjwos6i,"Where did you get that from? I admittedly provided a extreme, simplistic example to showcase my point, but don't tell me that if the top 1% of the population legally controlled 40% of the government we wouldn't start seeing some policies that favored large corporations at the expense of others. Hell, we see that today with current lobbying practices."

t3_2dzqgj,cjv9hrw,"Since the metaphorical playing field is uneven and biased towards being white and male more often than not, the respective ""scholarships"" (which mostly don't exist anyway) are easily justifiable. A much greater factor of injustice would be legacy scholarships, athletic scholarships, admittance for students who have had a family member donate significantly, etc--the first and third of which are always upper class-favoring. Where is the uproar about the more prevalent issue of people with money getting more free things?"

t3_2brzwb,cj8gj0l,"If you wouldn't, you are not open to changing your view. If you would, then you must admit that, in lieu of having the full picture, you should not preemptively make claims about what it is. "
t3_2bqtzl,cj810fl,"For that, Gordon was given a full-year suspension. For marijuana use...something that in URL almost 40% of the US population has admitted to (in actuality, the number is probably much higher). Unlike Ray Rice's attack on his then-fiancee, Josh Gordon's offense was victimless."
t3_2atkq9,ciysfit,"One of the problems with these new definitions of ""irony"" is that the describe things that are so vague that any one can point at nearly any situation that is even slightly coincidental or annoying and come up with a pseudo-argument that it could be considered ""ironic"" by the ever-changing goalposts of irony. Your strained apologia for Morrisette's own admitted misunderstanding of what irony is are a prime example of the horrors of this new concept of irony. If these things are irony, practically everything is irony."
t3_2ah6lr,civ4716,"As others have pointed out, people like me that check in at TiA acknowledge the underlying issues that concern the tumblerinas that we find. I'll be the first to admit that this world has work to do. However, the abject disconnect with reality espoused on certain tumblr blogs actually hinders progress."
t3_2ah2al,civ856q,"In fact, the current Israeli government has done great harm to the peace process and seems to be unwilling to accept anything short of complete surrender from the Palestinians. 3:05 Again, even he admits that he just lied a couple seconds ago. Last time I checked 95% didn't equal 100%."
t3_273kmd,chxabgz,"You have taken the possibility out of the scenario yourself by never wanting to try and never have had tried alcohol, so even if you were presented with positives you yourself could not even have enough information to make a decision that would affect everyone else in your country or the world with a straight face, if you treat alcohol like, say, meth. You have also ruled out the possibility for other ways to solve the (admittedly) bad side affects of alcohol when consumed in excess or used irresponsibly (such as before getting into a car, going to work under the influence, etc). Raising the legal limit, requiring stricter rules for getting a liquor/beer license, limiting the places someone could drink legally, raising the penalties for abusing alcohol, increased awareness through educational campaigns, etc have not even been considered, let alone thought through completely before simply thrown out with the bathwater by placing it on the same level, as say meth."
t3_24w84s,chb9mc7,"In some situations it's absolutely disadvantageous to be white, and telling white people in such situations to ""check their privilege"" is absolutely racist against those individuals due to the fact that you're assuming something about them because of the color of their skin. To clarify: does this mean you admit that ""checking one's privilege"" should be done on a micro level (as opposed to a macro level)? This is important, because societal inequalities do absolutely exist, but they can only be evaluated in any meaningful way on an individual (micro) level."
t3_24c1q3,ch63wru,"It seems to me like you think fetish is a bad word. You have some ""real"" fetishes, which I'm guessing are things you'd be embarrassed to admit, whereas you think that liking hair is natural, so it's not a ""fetish"". The reality is, you clearly have a fetish for pubic hair, since it increases your enjoyment of sex more than it would for a ""normal"" person in your age group (it's a preference that runs counter to the common desires of your age group)."
t3_24c1q3,ch5p4qj,"It also has to do with how slutty they are, but thats a whole nother thing. You'd have to admit though that asking a woman to trim instead of shave is just as much of an enforcement of prejudices on the woman as asking her to shave is, and maybe more so if she thinks you expect her to change her bathroom routine. most girls shave when they're shaving their legs too."
t3_222civ,cgir9ho,"There's a third option. Though the Constitution is straightforward on many things, you admit there's some ambiguity. But the Supreme Court only hears a small number of cases - those for which they're needed."
t3_20v70n,cg73vfe,"I agree with you that there are a lot of situations where lying causes confusion, and I agree that those are times where it might be better to tell the truth. But I think you have to admit that sometimes lies are better than truths. "
t3_20ofb2,cg5kvls,"I'm also curious about the differences between public and private schools there? Perhaps not all bullies have been physically abused at home and I admit that a lot of kids, like a lot of adults, are in fact jerks. I'm sure every person can recall being a jerk at some point in their childhood - because kids are still developing their sense of morality."
t3_1zj8xe,cfuptvj,"I would predict that that school would lose considerable prestige. I have to admit I'm skeptical about this. It would be kind of lame to call out a specific professor or school, but I'm genuinely interested in what kinds of classes you're taking and how often this is such a big issue."
t3_1z1xc4,cfprwpl,"Imagine there were a little person living inside you, but you did not invite him there. If it is a full person, as you suggest and I admit for the purpose of this discussion, then this little person has a right to live. But that does not necessarily imply that you as the other affected party is under any obligation to host the uninvited little person inside your body at great risk to yourself."
t3_1y0q8w,cfgq10w,"I think you have mistakenly made the link that the hospital pushing your friend out to palliative care is because they are dying is incorrect. They are pushing out your friend because hospitals routinely admit, treat and discharge patients. They attempt to only keep the patients that are needed and discharge patients to less acute areas (0 free beds = 0 movement from ER)."
t3_1y0q8w,cfgq10w,"They attempt to only keep the patients that are needed and discharge patients to less acute areas (0 free beds = 0 movement from ER). Optimally, all patients that are admitted will have a discharge plan. Patients in very acute areas, go to acute medicine, then continuing care, then discharged to home etc."
t3_1x3jm2,cf7w0x1,"You can't get any knew understanding of the world using Ken Ham's model. Further, Ken Ham admitted that there is no way to change his mind. Again, this is contrary to the very core of science."
t3_1wh80m,cf2a6xq,is internalized sexist notions in our society. Okay I'll admit I was shocked to not see this post as a misogynist jumble blaming women for all their supposed women's-problems and therefore sexism doesn't exist. Awesome!
t3_1t8yrt,ce5jyal,"> If this is true, then why aren't they already doing this? That would mean admitting they're wrong and make them openly admit they've been dishonest all this time. They want to keep the criminalization, the preposterous fines and so on."
t3_1rfn88,cdn4bxg,"It's sad, but the daytime talk shows, USA Today, Time magazine, Fox News, MSNBC (basically 99% of mainstream news sources) pander to the short attention span, gimmick addicted people who like being spoon fed sensationalized distractions. While you may be experiencing a ""filter bubble"" (it's good that you can admit that) I also think you are addressing a sad fact concerning what I see as a very large portion of our population. There are a lot of people who are not capable of discussing economic and environmental issues."
t3_1qran5,cdfnvr7,"It's a legal as well as an emotional contract. It's about sharing love and ensuring monogamy, which admittedly does often lead to children but they are not the reason that marriage exists. 3- Because same sex couples cant have children, you feel that there's no reason for them to marry."
t3_1ptfoy,cd65x34,"All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong. yep i caricatured you, i knew that i was caricaturing your viewpoint when i did it, don't worry I admit it. All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong."
t3_1orrrs,ccv4ank,I work with very low income families as a legal services attorney. I admit I often wonder why people don't wait until they can afford children to have them. I think part of the answer is that many of these people don't foresee a time when they will be better off.
t3_1oj3p9,ccsf2i1,"URL 3. URL (Although I admit this one is very politicized, so feel free to ignore it if you don't feel it is good to you personally). 4."
t3_1mq464,ccbrs5p,"Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word ""racist""? It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away. Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said ""this is what I'm talking about right here, guys"" without explaining why it's racist."
t3_1mcs7s,cc7zm90,"If people don't have food, they'll be in the streets rioting. We can either admit that full unemployment is at 5% is bad or we can keep with the welfare state to see that citizens are provided for along with keeping growth potential for companies. You're just seeing it first-hand and seeing culture cherry picked from elsewhere."
t3_1m4ncj,cc6efvb,"You're talking as if the Muslim people have taken over the government and police force and are ""making"" people do things and ""enforcing"" certain behaviours. Can you admit that this isn't true? Can you admit that the government of your country didn't create the No Christmas Trees Act of 2012?"
t3_1m4ncj,cc6efvb,Can you admit that this isn't true? Can you admit that the government of your country didn't create the No Christmas Trees Act of 2012? That the police don't take people away in handcuffs for serving pork?
t3_1lt0gt,cc2gt9x,"First of all, the notion of a ""two party system"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If 80% of the popular vote in every state had gone to Jill Stein, she would have become president, unless for some grand unprecedented fixing at the Congressional level (which admittedly could probably happen). Secondly, how do you even know that McCain and Romney would really be as bad as you feared?"
t3_1kj8ll,cbpisrw,"You still could meet a man to whom you felt sexually attracted. In fact, I bet you already have, you just didn't admit it due to religious, cultural or other reasons. So we will have to wait until you die to say that you never loved anyone of the same sex, and even if you do die without having loved anyone of the same sex, that could be because you lived in America your whole life and your one same-sex love was in Australia and you never met."""
t3_1kgh0u,cbooh2r,"If wealth is being transferred from rich to poor through means of theft and crime, there is no accountability to make sure that money gets used for anything of worth or will be put back into the economy in meaningful way. I'll be the first person to admit that inequality of wealth is a huge problem in our society. I always advocate for legal means of leveling the playing field, but I would never try and justify stealing to accomplish those goals."
t3_1k0rar,cbk70ve,"I am also part of several gay themes meetups and am,active in several gay organizations, in all instances, majority of men are partnered and most of those relationships are a decade if not decades long. Also, of course you admitted this. It is wildly unfair to judge gay people by criteria that they are not permitted to engage in, namely marriage."
t3_1juhcd,cbiftjn,"Well, we already know that our current model of physics is wrong at some point (see the attempt at creating the M-theory; quantum mechanics and general relativity produce bonkers results when used together). And we already admit that we do not understand what exactly dark matter and dark energy are in reality. But within our current model of physics, we can best describe them while using the english language to explain as ""invisible matter"" - because of our observation of unaccounted gravity coming from a source that we have not seen any light absorbed or reflected from."
t3_1inwvh,cb6b6rz,One group doesn't get to shut out the other group just because that group makes them uncomfortable. URL Gay bars have to admit straight people. 
t3_1hw3be,caykf0u,"It's not that correct spelling and grammar have intrinsic value, it's that they suggest the writer is educated and well read. People on the internet don't know you; they don't know if you're actually an expert in whatever you're talking about or if you're some regular schmo off the streets, so they have to look to other, sometimes admittedly superficial indicators of your credibility. Inasmuch as creating the impression of credibility is important for someone making an argument, then expressing that argument with correct spelling and grammar is important."

t3_1g05un,cafhkpm,"You stated in your ""edit"" that video games are art, but you do not consider gamers to be ""artists"". I think you have to admit that gaming is artistic expression though, if you also believe that enjoying the art forms I mentioned above counts as expression. "

t3_1fi40v,caahjdz,"Being happy is probably the best thing. One thing stemming from that is the need to be somewhat productive (getting goals accomplished that will make your life better), but taking care of yourself and admitting that you have a need to unwind is the flip side of productivity. What non-social things make you happy, OP?"
t3_1f3esr,ca6f5tm,"We would want the same for what we believe, it's best to have a ""let bygones be bygones"" mentality and allow the same. If you go through any Alcoholic's Anonymous or any sort of treatment program for a problem, the first step is always admitting that you have a problem. For those with homophobic, sexist, or racist views often by posting something such as that within a CMV format, they are stating that they have a problem."
t3_1dfy2a,c9q12ng,"Exactly the same thing as for men. You're not getting out of this without either admitting you want men to be treated unfairly, or you have the same advice (don't sleep around if you don't want or can't pay) for women. Which one is it going to be."
t3_1d44p3,c9mrjf5,"I know a total of 6 people who have been/are on antidepressants, one of which being mum and another two being literally my closest friends. So i probably speak more from experience rather than knowledge :/ As for the addiction thing, i have heard that being weaned off them is completely feasible although admittedly not a lot of fun, but neither is year upon year of deep depression. I think your last point about reality is really interesting, and wanders into philosophy to be honest."
t3_34mi2s,cqw2o4y,See above. If you were honest with yourself you would be forced to admit just how little you know. AKA ignorant.
t3_306b19,cpqv22p,"The idea I've had explained to me is that if we stop things that are outputting CO2 such as using our oil fuelled vehicles, which produce 19 pounds of CO2 per liter of gas used while driving according to URL we have a chance of stopping the increase in temperatures before the positive feedback loops become uncontrollable. I admit it is pretty hard to find good numbers to describe exactly how much CO2's put out by people driving, and studies show up with different numbers, but scientists appear to agree that it's a lot, and probably not a good idea to keep doing it. Another idea is that we do things that could absorb CO2 back into the earth, by doing things such as planting a lot of trees."
t3_2yrgi3,cpcb3au,"I'm not going to argue with any of the points you've made because, when it comes to policy, I agree that women should be generally excluded for the reasons you've listed.

t3_2v0u7q,codzu32,"As part of his argument he claims (falling back on his authority status) that consuming any amount of plant X will lead to an immediate death. Yet the day before, you've heard him admit to (or even saw him) taking (inhaling/ingesting/snuffing, whatever) a small amount of said plant in order to reach a different mental state. His apparent hypocrisy is directly relevant to the argument at hand, and you would be right to dismiss his claim, at least during the course of that debate."
