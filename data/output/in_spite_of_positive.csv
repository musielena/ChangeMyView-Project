Trinity Western Teaching College was, in spite of its frankly offensive policies towards gays in particular, was not denied accreditation or public funding b/c of s. 2; it also explicitly guarantees the rights of religious schools. The Charter has been used to strike laws restricting sex work, language rights, and a wide variety of abusive police tactics."
t3_2i1d99,ckxyj6k,"This is somewhat similar to the notion that people have that crime is becoming an even huger problem in the United States. In fact, crime has been decreasing more or less continuously since 1990, in spite of the increasing hysteria about it that started near the same time. That's not because crime is increasing, it's because you're hearing about it more."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"Their messages aren't even negative, just shallow and bland. While they are in a position to do more, their entire shtick is pleasant, inoffensive music and I believe their popularity is due to this, rather than in spite of it. If they tried to be the band you wanted them to be, they would likely lose their platform or the increased merit of their music would be lost on their audience."
t3_1yc8x2,cfjqxyk,"I think you should dismiss these views because they're arrived at though needs that have to do with emotion and identity and belonging, not function or experience or deliberate, focused study. In the Western world it is very political, so just having a point-of-view and choosing a side, regardless (and often in spite of) the reality is valued. In reality, you probably should not have much of an opinion on patriotism, just because the level of work isn't there to justify it."
t3_1xqnjx,cfdvt9y,"I think distraction due to laptops is a symptom of a different problem rather than a problem itself. Doodling or daydreaming I would say are more commonly distractions in spite of your anecdote that doodling helps you listen. The root problem is students not paying attention and lacking discipline, which is not cured by merely removing one distraction."
t3_1w6uhl,cezy174,"But regardless, those people exist and they exist in clusters. If I was infertile and my parents, siblings, and aunts and uncles wouldn't be supportive of adoption, I would be hard pressed to go ahead and do it in spite of them. That's just asking for a lifetime of ostracization, hushed conversations at family gatherings, and a really shitty environment for my child."
t3_1otp1b,ccvhvrl,"In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character. You don't see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series, in spite of the fact that they are aimed at similar audiences. I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own."
t3_1nrv36,cclsxnj,"Also, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I feel like you protest a bit too much. Are you angry that you are able to function well physically in spite of your weight, while other overweight people can't, and make a 'bad name' for people like yourself? Would you think nasty thoughts about yourself if you met him or her on the street?"
