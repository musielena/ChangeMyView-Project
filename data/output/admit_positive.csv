t3_2pimzj,cmx2c61,"I was specifically looking for someone to shed light on a group that I have never been personally involved with, yet had strong opinions on, because I may want my daughter to get involved. CMV is a sub where there appears to be a more cordial attitude toward debate with less impassioned mud-slinging, derision, and name calling (though I admit I have only been viewing content for a couple of weeks). It seems that if someone really wanted to get on a soapbox, they could merely head to a sub that specifically handled their topic (politics, religion, etc.)"
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"Dissent on the majority opinion is needed to make sure that the ideas are continually re evaluated to make sure they are as self evident as they are claimed to be. finally I hope that makes sense, because Ive been up since 12am yesterday, Ive had a rough day so I'll admit im half coherent. so if shits all misspelled or theres words out of place, or even rants that go off topic I apologize."
t3_2f48co,ck5siun,"This is a very unusual conspiracy theory to hold (and despite your proclamation to the contrary, it is most definitely a conspiracy theory) because Hollywood has traditionally been accused of being full of hard-left communists, something that generally runs counter to your claims. I must admit I don't see any easy way to convince you that you're wrong, because it's not really clear why you believe this stuff. I know we're supposed to be changing your view, not vice versa, but where's your evidence?"
t3_2c6m3v,cjd67az,"After 4-6 years of Critical thinking instruction, you could reasonably assume that these kids would be in what is currently the top 10 percentile in terms of critical thinking ability, and so what benefit would you expect to gain from teaching them philosophy? In my mind, something like game theory would be a better extension, but I'll admit I haven't thought deeply on what one should do after they've achieved very high levels of critical thinking ability. I think you'll find the beginning of this paper interesting ([Pencil and Paper argument mapping improves Critical Thinking Skills](https://www.academia.edu/772329/No_Computer_Program_Required_Even_Pencil-and-Paper_Argument_Mapping_Improves_Critical_Thinking_Skills))."
t3_2bqdam,cj828mm,"In just 10 years, because of compound interest, it can be worth $1,049.15. I'll admit I'm getting a little bit beyond just paying off the debt now. However, I assume the long-term goal here is financial independence."
t3_2bk0qs,cj64zeg,"Without getting bogged down in the messy logistics involved, what would you think of that solution? Well the issue of the victim's family is a little different, and I do have to admit its less clear cut. I have a hard time accepting that idea as real, meaning I have no reason to believe that solution would actually help the family at all, but I can't unilaterally declare that it would not."
t3_2ah6lr,civ3itz,"Whereas doing so on SRS is a banworthy offense. I'll admit the thread you linked about Islamaphobia is depressing, but I've also seen a lot of instances of people on TiA jumping all over people expressing bigoted views. "
t3_2a7f52,cisazcd,The show isn't for everyone but The show is so much fun if you don't look so closely at its flaws and just take it for what it is. I will admit some episodes are just dreadful but being a show on possibilities the next episode can be anything and when they knock it out of the park they really do a fantastic job. 
t3_27poi8,ci35etu,Because of this I think that it would be best to give students to option to either do a project or a test. First off I have to admit that I have a huge bias. I am far better at tests than I am at projects.
t3_255qch,chdyl7n,"That, and I don't like supporting either culture or law in scenarios where it makes no sense. That said, I'll admit it's a personal choice and there's nothing ethically or morally wrong about preferring to always wait. What would you do if the crosswalk light never changed?"
t3_1um2og,cejgnup,"The amount of thimerosal in the vaccines that have it (not all do and you can easily request one that does not have it) have only a trace amount text , so you will need to get a massive volume of the vaccine in your system for it to even have an affect on you, let alone be dangerous. The method to determine exactly what strain to create a vaccine for has some pretty complicated math invovled (which I admit I don't fully understand), URL Because you acknowledge the advantage of herd immunity for malaria and polio, I am going to assume you know how it works. Let me know if you want me to explain it."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy2o2r,So just to make my point clear. Yes I admit that Gandhi has become a propaganda tool for the state. But that does not mean that he did not accomplish stuff which has a lot for us to learn.
t3_1qwdul,cdj5vts,"I have yet to see a testimonial where a bro is like ""yeah, I negged the shit out of this girl and took her home within the hour and now we are celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary at a B&amp;B in Vermont!"" I don't doubt that it happens, just that, uh I have to admit I'm kind of getting mixed signals here. If women really DO fall for you when they get to know you, I can tell you with absolute confidence that you are already better off than basically every man who can spit mad game but has very little going for him beyond it."
t3_1qfo09,cdcconr,"As long as those attitudes exist, they can't be equal. Your argument could be rephrased as ""I get that they want to be equal, and I'm find with them having equal rights, I just don't want to admit that they're equal"" You can say two halves or three thirds, but either way it still comes out to the same thing, and there's no valid reason to deny that. People don't want to give up the word marriage because they think it's special, and reserved just for them, and that by letting gays marry they'd be tarnishing the word."
t3_1ozdmq,ccx6cho,No society can survive without that sense of self-interest and by my moral code my society will always come above others. It is not hypocrisy because I do admit I act in self-interest and find no shame in doing so. The people who do spout moral justifications and the endless rationalizations do so because that is what makes them more comfortable to act in their self-interest.
t3_1l3hck,cbvusd3,"Right, but we can choose how to deal with those offenses. I'll admit that I'm a big advocate for free speech because I think it's been instrumental in the very best ideas that humanity has come up with, so I might be a little biased. But I also steadfastly believe that rights, equality, and acceptance are things that are fought for tooth and nail."
t3_1klpoz,cbqe15e,"Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs. There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both URL and URL (two very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural. They progressed as opposed to mutated."
t3_1hajga,cass9ux,"To argue otherwise seems to take such a negative view of both men's and women's fundamental characters that it would stand to argue men and women should be totally segregated because it's toxic for them to have interaction in any sort of professional setting. On this topic I admit there wasn't a lot of hand to hand combat in my service branch, especially in the rate I was a member of. If you have experience in this area I must yield to your presumed superior first hand knowledge on the subject."
t3_1ghg9u,cakhjuz,"The Koran, like many religious texts (including the bible), often appears contradictory. I admit I don't know as much about the history of the Koran as I should, but for the bible, it is fairly easy to explain why - all the books were written by different people, and though divinely inspired, they simply didn't cross-check everything to make sure the points were the same. For 8.065 specifically, it seems like that verse is the Koran equivalent of Luke 1:37 - ""Nothing is impossible with god""."
t3_1ehvba,ca0getj,"More often than not, it isn't. If you divorce war from the reality of the massive death and suffering caused I admit it doesn't seem as bad. That's a trivial statement, however; death and suffering are the primary cost of war."
t3_1dy3sl,c9uym99,"Or the outdated and offensive traditional gender roles that feminists are trying to get rid of? Now, I'm definitely going to admit that feminism hasn't really done a good job of addressing these issues, but hell, earlier this year, 80% of congress and the senate were men, and even that was considered a breakthrough in the amount of women present in the US government. I don't know why you think that feminists are the ones creating these toxic ideas when we're still fighting for rudimentary things like birth control and abortion rights."
t3_1cjeto,c9h2lgb,"Well first of all you'd have to accept that many people do actually like the taste, even though you personally don't. I'll admit it was an acquired taste where i didnt like most alcoholic beverages at first, but over time those flavors built up positive associations in my mind and i found myself enjoying them. Despite not particularly.liking them at first, nowadays i'll have some whiskey just for the pleasre of drinking it (flavor, feel, and buzz)."
t3_1c8ym3,c9e9zzx,"That is the sort of ""safe space"" /r/MR is: it allows people, of all genders, to go and say ""hey, I don't like this aspect of society"" and not be immediately accused of being driven by hatred. I'll admit that occasionally, MR sickens me, but as much as the occasional instances of clear misogyny revolt me, I cannot help but go back on occasion, because without them to tell me that no, I'm not mad and evil and hateful to point out the hypocrisy of gender politics, I would go mad, and drift into actual misogyny out of bitter resentment at the double standard. "
t3_1bk94x,c97fll5,"I don't like to eat the same thing every day - why should I have to dress or look the same way every day? I do admit it's unwise to sacrifice comfort for pleasing others, but you also please yourself. When I see someone fit on television and admire their dedication to a fitness routine and I achieve a comparable level of fitness - it's something I can feel happy about."
t3_34dp1h,cqtp0m2,"So, in summary, UKIP are bad news. However, I have to admit that I'm with them on hospital parking fees. ~~Edit: Well, it looks like OP has hit and and run."
t3_2wwm6s,cousnad,"Even if diseases evolve in such a way that our vaccines and antibiotics aren't effective anymore, why would we be worse-off in that case than we were before we had those tools in the first place? This is an appeal to present political circumstances, and I admit that those circumstances could change a lot over half a millennium. But I put it to you that they aren't likely to change in a way that challenges the point."
