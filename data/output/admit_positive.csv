t3_1um2og,cejgnup,"The method to determine exactly what strain to create a vaccine for has some pretty complicated math invovled (which I admit I don't fully understand), URL Because you acknowledge the advantage of herd immunity for malaria and polio, I am going to assume you know how it works."

t3_33umft,cqok9d6,"But I'll admit to being a bit judgemental and unforgiving on this issue--if a person not only holds clearly bigoted sentiments but is willing to post or argue in favor of them on Reddit (which probably implies that they're younger than the stereotypical ""racist grandma"" and may hold those views in defiance of the people they know), I usually consider them fundamentally ""tainted"" and find it hard to look past their views."
