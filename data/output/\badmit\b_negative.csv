t3_2q9fkx,cn4ebjb,"A more sensible calendar might be, like, a little better, but how much? Most people don't spend a lot of time doing the kind of calendar arithmetic that would be alleviated by moving to a slightly more intuitive calendar - which, as you admit yourself, still wouldn't be perfect since a full year is 365.24998798765 days long, or whatever the number is. If a calendar must be imperfect due to the very nature of the thing it's measuring, why would we want to change to a new one?"
t3_2o2kga,cmj4j7t,"These seem like the words of someone who is able to think clearly and reason what the future implications will be if she stays with the guy that night. Now I will admit the line of ""Say, what's in this drink"" could be seem as concerning, but prior to that she talks about having half a drink more. So they were both already drinking."
t3_2mqzo8,cm6vifg,"And if you aren't going to a high end college, well then its not near as expensive (sticker price). I admit I was not totally clear with the generational wealth thing. So, for example, there were various government programs which helped whites buy houses in suburbia, post-WW2."
t3_2lvano,clyhfb1,"writing a letter), it's extremely difficult to successfully gauge whether the physical space available will perfectly match what you eventually write and whether it will ultimately look as neat as possible. Now (and I admit this is subjective), I'd consider a letter that has uneven spacing to be less neat than a letter where perfect columns are maintained throughout and hyphens are used to complete words exceeding the available column space. It does sometimes create a mental pause when read, but it still often looks more professional and more coherent than an item where words are squeezed into tight margins or written out fully in spite of the margins."
t3_2lqmp9,clxmady,"I'm actually really surprised nobody here seems to have mentioned that yet. We can admit that the Nazi imagery and propaganda were remarkably effective without agreeing with their goals or methods. That's why Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (a ground-breaking Nazi propaganda film) is still so widely praised, mimicked, and studied even while its message is rejected."
t3_2ixatz,cl6g9da,"Remember without a star in proximity the temperature would constantly be dropping. At this point let's bring back in my first reason- we haven't yet found any evidence that intelligent life exists anywhere but here on earth so the likely hood of any aliens coming from a nearby star is incredibly low, otherwise we would have seen evidence of their existence before now- though I do admit it's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, the same odds are against the hopeful invaders. So to sum up- What would be the point of travelling an enormous distance and consuming an enormous amount of resource to come and kill us- to steal our resource?"
t3_2hfggr,cks5dxq,"The biggest thing would be why you aren't attracted to a black person, white person, etc? I think you are kidding yourself if you don't think that media and society influences what you find attractive, and it most certainly influences what you admit to finding attractive. An example I am more aware of is in the US at least a lot of men have ""yellow fever."""
t3_2e4b5f,cjwigez,"If you believe that strongly in justice, I will PM you the names of all the people accused of crimes in my area so you can make the world right with your internet lynch mob. So you are saying that you would willingly put a cop and their family in danger just so that cop would admit to guilt (whether or not they believed they were guilty). If you believe that strongly in justice, I will PM you the names of all the people accused of crimes in my area so you can make the world right with your internet lynch mob."
t3_2brzwb,cj8gj0l,"If you wouldn't, you are not open to changing your view. If you would, then you must admit that, in lieu of having the full picture, you should not preemptively make claims about what it is. "
t3_2ah6lr,civ4716,"As others have pointed out, people like me that check in at TiA acknowledge the underlying issues that concern the tumblerinas that we find. I'll be the first to admit that this world has work to do. However, the abject disconnect with reality espoused on certain tumblr blogs actually hinders progress."
t3_24w84s,chb9mc7,"In some situations it's absolutely disadvantageous to be white, and telling white people in such situations to ""check their privilege"" is absolutely racist against those individuals due to the fact that you're assuming something about them because of the color of their skin. To clarify: does this mean you admit that ""checking one's privilege"" should be done on a micro level (as opposed to a macro level)? This is important, because societal inequalities do absolutely exist, but they can only be evaluated in any meaningful way on an individual (micro) level."
t3_24c1q3,ch63wru,"It seems to me like you think fetish is a bad word. You have some ""real"" fetishes, which I'm guessing are things you'd be embarrassed to admit, whereas you think that liking hair is natural, so it's not a ""fetish"". The reality is, you clearly have a fetish for pubic hair, since it increases your enjoyment of sex more than it would for a ""normal"" person in your age group (it's a preference that runs counter to the common desires of your age group)."
t3_24c1q3,ch5p4qj,"It also has to do with how slutty they are, but thats a whole nother thing. You'd have to admit though that asking a woman to trim instead of shave is just as much of an enforcement of prejudices on the woman as asking her to shave is, and maybe more so if she thinks you expect her to change her bathroom routine. most girls shave when they're shaving their legs too."
t3_222civ,cgir9ho,"There's a third option. Though the Constitution is straightforward on many things, you admit there's some ambiguity. But the Supreme Court only hears a small number of cases - those for which they're needed."
t3_20v70n,cg73vfe,"I agree with you that there are a lot of situations where lying causes confusion, and I agree that those are times where it might be better to tell the truth. But I think you have to admit that sometimes lies are better than truths. "
t3_20ofb2,cg5kvls,"I'm also curious about the differences between public and private schools there? Perhaps not all bullies have been physically abused at home and I admit that a lot of kids, like a lot of adults, are in fact jerks. I'm sure every person can recall being a jerk at some point in their childhood - because kids are still developing their sense of morality."
t3_1zj8xe,cfuptvj,"I would predict that that school would lose considerable prestige. I have to admit I'm skeptical about this. It would be kind of lame to call out a specific professor or school, but I'm genuinely interested in what kinds of classes you're taking and how often this is such a big issue."
t3_1z1xc4,cfprwpl,"Imagine there were a little person living inside you, but you did not invite him there. If it is a full person, as you suggest and I admit for the purpose of this discussion, then this little person has a right to live. But that does not necessarily imply that you as the other affected party is under any obligation to host the uninvited little person inside your body at great risk to yourself."
t3_1y0q8w,cfgq10w,"I think you have mistakenly made the link that the hospital pushing your friend out to palliative care is because they are dying is incorrect. They are pushing out your friend because hospitals routinely admit, treat and discharge patients. They attempt to only keep the patients that are needed and discharge patients to less acute areas (0 free beds = 0 movement from ER)."
t3_1wh80m,cf2a6xq,is internalized sexist notions in our society. Okay I'll admit I was shocked to not see this post as a misogynist jumble blaming women for all their supposed women's-problems and therefore sexism doesn't exist. Awesome!
t3_1t8yrt,ce5jyal,"> If this is true, then why aren't they already doing this? That would mean admitting they're wrong and make them openly admit they've been dishonest all this time. They want to keep the criminalization, the preposterous fines and so on."
t3_1rfn88,cdn4bxg,"It's sad, but the daytime talk shows, USA Today, Time magazine, Fox News, MSNBC (basically 99% of mainstream news sources) pander to the short attention span, gimmick addicted people who like being spoon fed sensationalized distractions. While you may be experiencing a ""filter bubble"" (it's good that you can admit that) I also think you are addressing a sad fact concerning what I see as a very large portion of our population. There are a lot of people who are not capable of discussing economic and environmental issues."
t3_1ptfoy,cd65x34,"All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong. yep i caricatured you, i knew that i was caricaturing your viewpoint when i did it, don't worry I admit it. All the wins are wins, and I'm only wrong when I'm wrong."
t3_1orrrs,ccv4ank,I work with very low income families as a legal services attorney. I admit I often wonder why people don't wait until they can afford children to have them. I think part of the answer is that many of these people don't foresee a time when they will be better off.
t3_1oj3p9,ccsf2i1,"URL 3. URL (Although I admit this one is very politicized, so feel free to ignore it if you don't feel it is good to you personally). 4."
t3_1mcs7s,cc7zm90,"If people don't have food, they'll be in the streets rioting. We can either admit that full unemployment is at 5% is bad or we can keep with the welfare state to see that citizens are provided for along with keeping growth potential for companies. You're just seeing it first-hand and seeing culture cherry picked from elsewhere."
t3_1m4ncj,cc6efvb,"You're talking as if the Muslim people have taken over the government and police force and are ""making"" people do things and ""enforcing"" certain behaviours. Can you admit that this isn't true? Can you admit that the government of your country didn't create the No Christmas Trees Act of 2012?"
t3_1m4ncj,cc6efvb,Can you admit that this isn't true? Can you admit that the government of your country didn't create the No Christmas Trees Act of 2012? That the police don't take people away in handcuffs for serving pork?
t3_1kj8ll,cbpisrw,"You still could meet a man to whom you felt sexually attracted. In fact, I bet you already have, you just didn't admit it due to religious, cultural or other reasons. So we will have to wait until you die to say that you never loved anyone of the same sex, and even if you do die without having loved anyone of the same sex, that could be because you lived in America your whole life and your one same-sex love was in Australia and you never met."""
t3_1kgh0u,cbooh2r,"If wealth is being transferred from rich to poor through means of theft and crime, there is no accountability to make sure that money gets used for anything of worth or will be put back into the economy in meaningful way. I'll be the first person to admit that inequality of wealth is a huge problem in our society. I always advocate for legal means of leveling the playing field, but I would never try and justify stealing to accomplish those goals."
t3_1juhcd,cbiftjn,"Well, we already know that our current model of physics is wrong at some point (see the attempt at creating the M-theory; quantum mechanics and general relativity produce bonkers results when used together). And we already admit that we do not understand what exactly dark matter and dark energy are in reality. But within our current model of physics, we can best describe them while using the english language to explain as ""invisible matter"" - because of our observation of unaccounted gravity coming from a source that we have not seen any light absorbed or reflected from."
t3_1inwvh,cb6b6rz,One group doesn't get to shut out the other group just because that group makes them uncomfortable. URL Gay bars have to admit straight people. 
t3_1hj6bs,cauydog,"Can I eat him? There's no hard line, but you have to admit that there are differences between crickets, snakes, rabbits, dogs, and apes. "
t3_1g05un,cafhkpm,"You stated in your ""edit"" that video games are art, but you do not consider gamers to be ""artists"". I think you have to admit that gaming is artistic expression though, if you also believe that enjoying the art forms I mentioned above counts as expression. "

t3_34mi2s,cqw2o4y,See above. If you were honest with yourself you would be forced to admit just how little you know. AKA ignorant.
t3_306b19,cpqv22p,"The idea I've had explained to me is that if we stop things that are outputting CO2 such as using our oil fuelled vehicles, which produce 19 pounds of CO2 per liter of gas used while driving according to URL we have a chance of stopping the increase in temperatures before the positive feedback loops become uncontrollable. I admit it is pretty hard to find good numbers to describe exactly how much CO2's put out by people driving, and studies show up with different numbers, but scientists appear to agree that it's a lot, and probably not a good idea to keep doing it. Another idea is that we do things that could absorb CO2 back into the earth, by doing things such as planting a lot of trees."
t3_2v0u7q,codzu32,"As part of his argument he claims (falling back on his authority status) that consuming any amount of plant X will lead to an immediate death. Yet the day before, you've heard him admit to (or even saw him) taking (inhaling/ingesting/snuffing, whatever) a small amount of said plant in order to reach a different mental state. His apparent hypocrisy is directly relevant to the argument at hand, and you would be right to dismiss his claim, at least during the course of that debate."
t3_2u460b,co5wbvc,"So yeah, trigger warnings should really only be reserved for those who have had traumatic experiences. Because now I can't even admit my triggers without people mocking me or looking at me funny, which sucks. "
t3_2tn8qu,co11da9,"There still might be some cases where population control might solve a problem in the world. But you'd have to admit that ""the majority of the world's international issues could be curbed or solved by population control"" is a bit much. "
