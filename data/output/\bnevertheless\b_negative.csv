t3_2bag31,cj3f08t,"It may be a part of the culture to show off your many charitable deeds, but a billionaire who gives a lot of money to charity is still doing something he or she doesn't have to do, and if they give enough it is unexpected. And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss . They may not be more generous than you, but they're still generous."
t3_2a299i,ciqt0e3,"It's about interests and making people share your interests. The conservative movement has been working on people for decades, people who were being screwed by the policies the conservatives advocated nevertheless were convinced that those policies were in their interest. Or that their interest in X (say, abortion) was way, way more important than their interest in Y (say, a tax structure that rewarded actual work instead of just owning things)."

These include things which are not objective, but multiple people will nevertheless tend to value similarly. Some morality questions fall in this catagory."
