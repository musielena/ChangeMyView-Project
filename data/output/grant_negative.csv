t3_2of8dd,cmmlkew,"If you don't have a specific food allergy and don't plan on having anyone over who does, why would cross-contamination even cross your mind? Your premise is already taken for granted by a vast majority of people, so I don't understand why this is even worthy of an argument in the first place. It would be like saying, ""CMV: Since I'm not handicapped and none of my friends are, it is not my responsibility to make my house handicap accessible."""
t3_2mm2dl,cm5imes,"Say, for instance, that welfare was funded solely through income tax. In that case, since illegal immigrants wouldn't be paying income tax, they wouldn't be entitled to welfare. But, because tax money, at least on the federal level, is pooled together and then distributed where it's needed, you'd be hard-pressed to limit the public services illegal immigrants get in a way that is fair."

t3_2mm2dl,cm5iqtr,"For example, everyone pays sales taxes when they purchase almost anything. If an illegal immigrant purchases alcohol or tobacco they are paying taxes. If they buy gas then they are paying taxes."
t3_2mm2dl,cm5iqtr,"If they own property they pay property taxes. If illegal immigrants pay these types of taxes, why should they not be eligible to receive at least some public services? Also, it's impossible to stop illegal immigrants from using all public services."

t3_2mm2dl,cm5iqtr,How do you ensure that they don't receive emergency services? How does the military protect its citizens but not illegal immigrants? The list goes on and on.
t3_2mm2dl,cm5l70x,How would you go about detaining 11 million people? I don't think it's possible to catch every illegal immigrant at any given time. 3.
t3_2mm2dl,cm5o5yv,I'm selling my house. An illegal immigrant offers me cash for it. I accept.
t3_2mm2dl,cm5o5yv,"I accept. An illegal immigrant now owns land. You're right, this was clearly wrong, which is why the U.S. government formally apologized and paid reparations to those who were put in internment camps."
t3_2mm2dl,cm5o5yv,"The U.S. put 110,000-120,000 people into internment camps. There are ~11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. right now (estimates vary). Detaining 110,000-120,000 people is a lot different than detaining 11 million, especially when those 110,000-120,000 were mostly documented citizens and thus were easy to find."
t3_2mm2dl,cm5o5yv,Building and maintaining public roads is a public service that is paid for through taxes. Denying illegal immigrants the use of public services is more than denying them from using public schools or welfare. 
t3_2lvdpt,clyjeyd,"I'm not arguing that once an individual becomes 16, they 'magically mature' - I'm arguing that an adult who initiates a sexual relationship with an underage person is highly likely to be engaging in a relationship with an individual who is not yet physically and mentally mature, and that ultimately holds true regardless of claims surrounding the apparent promiscuity of boys vis-a-vis girls or the sex of the abuser. I can see where you're coming from, but ultimately we have to draw the line somewhere (barring some kind of system whereby medical practitioners individually assess people and legally declare their ability to grant consent). As things stand, the scientific consensus holds that an individual aged 14 or 15 is unlikely to have either completed physical growth or their full mental development (most critically, their ability to rationally determine consequential outcomes)."
t3_2jalt8,cla00dw,"Your problem seems to be based on the mistaken belief that property is a thing rather than a legal relationship to a thing. Whether you're talking about the sale of widgets or cattle or land or movies, it's the same principle, you are selling a government-granted, government-enforced ""bundle of rights"" to some tangible or intangible asset in exchange for some other government-granted, government-enforced asset. For the same reason society is compelled to adhere to any other property law, it is the bedrock upon which civilization and markets are built."
t3_2j4itf,cl8by7v,"I'm am not sure about how to approach changing your view. It seems to me that one must take either of the following positions; Rights are granted from an external authority: God given, or ""Natural"" rights. Rights are granted from other people."
t3_2j4itf,cl8by7v,"It seems to me that one must take either of the following positions; Rights are granted from an external authority: God given, or ""Natural"" rights. Rights are granted from other people. Surely you recognise that you benefit from prohibitions on theft and murder, whether from the 10 commandments, from the government protecting those rights, or from a social contract."
t3_2j4itf,cl8by7v,"Edited to reply to your edit: Not sure how this impacts a view of rights. Even granted a belief in god, humans are not gods. So why does it follow that humans would have any attribute of god?"
t3_2j4itf,cla9i9a,"Someone can violate your ""right to life"", Society sets out protect your ""right to life"" by punishing murder, manslaughter, etc. This seems a more practical way to look at rights, especially since the nation or society is what promotes and protects rights, even if you feel ""god granted you those rights"". God only protects rights through after-life threats and rewards."
t3_2j4itf,cla9i9a,"....""The holocaust never happened."" In the US, the US Government grants you the right to be free from government persecution, if you say ""The holocaust never happened.""

t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,Universal healthcare is a must. Government grants could be given out for promising ideas. The legal system could (technically) be rewritten to be more class-neutral.
t3_2g1ea5,ckesi7g,"And NY does have good deep dish style pizzas (sold as sicilian slices normally). I'll grant you that a calzone can go more topping heavy, but at the expense of explosiveness and jaw-dislocation. A calzone will be taller than a pizza at any level of topping."
t3_2fu5da,cke4u4s,"Just because on principle, in a perfect world that doesn't exist, we should win without it? I personally agree that if sexuality was 100% a choice, we should still grant equal rights, exactly like religion. However, most other civil rights battles have been won for inherent traits."
t3_2ervii,ck2ndkx,"A big business isn't going to live under a bridge when it doesn't get a job, but an employee can't refuse to work just because everybody offers unhumane working conditions, he needs to pay for stuff. 2) In a ""free market"" it might not be worth 11$, but again a free market also wouldn't limit your working hours per day or would grant you days off. 3) How do you imagine decreasing the number of workers?"
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Done with a little back story. Now in the late 1800's, a man named Theodore Herzl started what is to be now known as political Zionism, which is a movement to grant Jew's their own state. Their books say they will be put through immense grief as a way of proving(?)"
t3_2c0frm,cjbcce2,It changes. I've seen times where that sub had nothing but serious stuff on the front page too (granted it's not that common but it happens). 
t3_286wmt,ci8clpg,"By using it only in a positive context and never in a negative context. Lets take immigrants as an example, if a lot of negative things like crime and stuff are associated with immigrants the word get's negative. Now when you change the word to mean positive things like contributions to society you can redeem the word to be positive."
t3_26b1l1,chpr7to,"It is also essentially a defense mechanism to avoid acknowledging a potentially offensive politically incorrect fact down the road. I'll grant that ""white"" is a social construct; in the past it was applied to different groups, and even nowadays there's probably more distance between a Greek and a Norwegian than there is between a Greek and an Arab (yet the Greek and Norwegian would be considered white, but the Arab would not be considered white), but that's at best a red herring. "
t3_24faei,ch6s907,"First off, laws can change state by state. For us, grandparents can only be granted visitation if a parent dies, we divorce, or the child had loved with the GP for a year or longer before being denied access. HOWEVER, these are all overruled by the ""best interest of the child"" clause."
t3_22xij5,cgrdf4t,"But I'd be a fool if I didn't acknowledge that these factors have helped give me an advantage in many aspects of my life. And when I go in to work and look around at my female coworker, my gay coworker, and my black coworker, its important that I acknowledge that many basic aspects of my life that I take for granted are not shared by them often (but not always) in ways that make things harder for them. You're not supposed to feel guilty, you're just supposed to acknowledge and understand how it affects you and others around you."
t3_22p8vc,cgp2qt7,"If culture were largely genetically predetermined, these cultures would be far more homogenous. Additionally, looking at first generation immigrants versus their parents demonstrates a large difference in how similar genetics can operate very differently in different social constructs. If behavior and values are largely genetically predetermined, then we would see the children of those raised in a different culture holding onto the same social constructs as their parents, while they are far more likely to assimilate and reflect the values of the culture they were raised in."

t3_1zrq6d,cfwexd1,"Finally there's the common argument that under the current subscription model, society is paying a large fee to read research that it already funded with tax-payer dollars in many cases. I personally believe that if research was funded by government grants, any publication that results should be made available to the public for free. Full disclosure: I published in PLoS One last year, so my opinion is a bit biased."
t3_1xzeag,cffzfv6,"So I would agree that 18 is too old to allow someone to start voting. I agree with your principle, though, that there are plenty of 8 year olds who are just as capable of making decisions like that as many adults that we grant the right to. "
t3_1xhgv0,cfbpidx,"Most of the time you find that they actually do accept evidence-based ways of obtaining knowledge, they only reject them when it contradicts their existing religion-based ideas about society. Most religious fundamentalists will grant that a detective can solve a murder case, which is evidence based knowledge in one of its most basic forms. Science is very similar, but has built a very complex case over a very long period of time about the way the universe works."

t3_1tqttm,ceakm2y,"The main argument is about how animals are treated prior to their death, and considering that essentially all meat produced comes from factory farms, this is what matters. The amount of meat produced by small mom and pop farms would not feed the population of long island alone, so their existence is essentially negligible when trying to determine how one should act in the real world, even if it were granted that this was an acceptable source (which is questionable in itself). The animals produced by these factory farms endure unfathomable levels of suffering, and every time you pay the farm for their services, you encourage more of it."

t3_1qran5,cdfnvr7,"Again I will reiterate that marriage is not always about reproduction. Marriage grants couples certain legal rights such as reduced tax, combined insurance etc. Should homosexuals marry the opposite sex and lead a miserable life to get the same perks that you can get being happily married?"
t3_1p0cwf,ccxfymz,"From what I can tell, it seems like the rate of technological advancement has been accelerating and shows no sign of ceasing. 50 years ago, people would have had no ability to imagine stuff like smartphones, laptops, hybrid cars, and many other things that we take for granted. Even if you only look back just 10 years there has been massive advancement in information technology."
t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"Peace exists because there's someone walking around with a very very big, unpleasant stick that wants peace to continue. Occasional extreme and asymmetrical violence is the unpleasant cost of the peaceful world we take for granted. Freedom isn't free, and it's no less free simply because we've already beaten down the biggest threats out there to it."

t3_1nkqn7,ccjhz72,"The one thing that many people don't realize is how the US came to be. We are a true immigrant nation, and the people who came to the US dropped what little they had and spent days or even weeks on a ship risking death for opportunity. This mind set can be considered independent and determined, and it seems to be passed down to the nation we know today."
t3_1mjw31,cc9yys4,"Say what you want about Lost as a series, but it had some damn good individual episodes. Now these aren't examples of prequels, I'll grant you that, but they do demonstrate that you don't need the tension of an uncertain ending to make a compelling story. One final point - there have even been studied that suggest that knowing the ending can enhance one's enjoyment of a story."
t3_1l48mt,cbvwhwi,"To this I would mention many many people donate to what emotionally impacts the donator. What if an underprivileged youth was granted the opportunity to see an opera, go to an otherwise unaffordable museum, or given the opportunity to go to college and this opportunity changed that persons life in such a way that they became hugely successful? Because of what helped them, the donator is going to support the organization that supported him/her."
t3_1l3r2u,cbvi6i2,"Finally, tuition is not a scam, really. Most private universities (you know, the expensive ones) make most of their money from patents, investments, and research grants. Remember, the point of a university is to have a place for academics to do research, and also educate students to create the next generation of academics."
t3_1jukj2,cbij1va,"Even without existential crises (which is not, I might add, a direct function of knowledge or intelligence, as religion, an aspect of humanity that has existed since civilization began, is arguably a way of dealing with existential crisis), life in those times were hard enough that there would be other distressors; disease and death were very real phenomena that existed at a much greater prevalence. Especially, > the little things like their family or a good meal These are not things that could simply be taken for granted for all of human history. In the vast majority, I'd argue, of places in history, ""a good meal"" was something that only the rich and powerful could obtain with any amount of frequency."
t3_1j7p6i,cbby8gg,"Also, if you get health insurance through your employer (highly likely) it's not as bad as its made out to be. ""The aggressive nature of law enforcement""...I'll grant you a lot of cops are arrogant, but this isn't something you see in the vast majority of the US. 26 years and I've never had a problem with them."
t3_1htdmd,caxz72q,"Regulators may apply different standards to businesses they have a direct financial stake in. They might grant approval for certain business requests they normally wouldn't, turn a blind eye to environmental damage, approve a new drug prematurely, favor the business over another business in civil disputes etc. Another reason there has been resistance in the US to the government directly owning a stake in private companies is because there are some eerie similarities to how the economy of fascism works."
t3_1h9hye,cas9uz8,"I have personally witnessed the former at parsnip farms. I've heard many first hand accounts from migrant workers about similar scourges, while the farmer covers his ears and pretends nothing is wrong. 9."
t3_1h5bo4,car096v,"Here's the juicy bit from pg. 25: States grant marriage licenses, not the federal government. So Kennedy's ruling essentially holds that the Federal Government cannot treat certain legally married couples differently than others."
t3_1h5bo4,car096v,"So again, this ruling does not render ""unconstitutional the uniformly applied right to marry someone of the opposite gender."" It merely holds that where States have deemed people to be married, the Federal Government should grant them the same marriage benefits. Let me know if I can clarify please."
t3_1fdqr9,ca997cz,"Also, I say we should go one step further beyond making sure that racism shouldn't be spread to future generations and try and stamp it out in current ones. I'm South Asian, and hear a lot of racist stuff from some members of the immigrant generation here. The members that don't say anything are those who's kids got married to non-South Asians, and realized that their beliefs were wrong."
t3_1e71tp,c9xez56,"When he gets Eve to eat the apples (though Satan isn't even mentioned in Genesis but as we are going to speak from an area that you are mostly ignorant except for the selective areas that support your opinion and yet have formed a decisive opinion) it is not because he wishes her to receive greater knowledge of science and logic or whatever. It is because he is envious of the paradise they have been granted when compared to his residence in hell. If we take moral judgement to be based on intention, not on outcome (see Kant and the Categorical imperative), then, as Satan's intention is the will to destroy which fails miserably under the Universality Principle (if all were to follow the same goal the outcome would be bad), we must judge him to be immoral."
t3_1e30x9,c9wohh6,"Medicine and infrastructure shouldn't be profit industries. I find the mass of whiny middle class kids who seem to think that a 4 year degree automatically grants them entrance into above-working class working conditions and wages probably more annoying than you do, but their complaint has a kernel of legitimacy to it. The availability of Middle Class Privilege has been the carrot used to justify basing our economy on the caprices of the market."
t3_1e30x9,c9wbvj3,"Students had to work harder because teachers had better incentive and funding to allow for time and better programs. The sad truth is that teachers today are less skilled and have less time due to low incentive granted by educational funding in the US. Math and Science, being complex to learn for most without guidance, are easily given up on without heavy teacher encouragement."
t3_1e0dd7,c9vkmsv,"And it really does only take the right economic conditions - See the ""Golden Dawn"" party of Greece. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_(Greece)#Parliament Influx of immigrants followed by a terrible depression - it's the perfect storm. Everybody looks for someone to blame, and it must not be the ""true"" Greeks."
t3_1e0dd7,c9vkmsv,"Who isn't a ""true Greek""? Immigrants, gays, jews...the usual suspects. So you are quite literally witnessing the potential rebirth of that ideology."
t3_1e0dd7,c9vkmsv,"But imagine if the most recent recession looked more like the Great Depression. There would probably have been public cries by many to mass deport Central and South American immigrants. The German depression that brought about the Holocaust was much, much worse than our current recession."
t3_1am1gg,c8yp91p,"If you want an example of scientific advancement which had an incredible effect on the world, look no further than URL whose research resulted in avoiding world hunger. I would grant that the social change of wealth and high quality of life typically yields a slowing of population growth which assists in making these advances sustainable. At the same time, that is one of the beautiful parts of science where it works well in tandem."
t3_35007e,cr08now,I dont. People granted the legitimation by the people they have to represent must be held accountable for every offense that would be an offense if commited by any of said legitimators. Otherwise I dont see a point in having a representative.
t3_34uoe6,cqydmf0,"That example is just one of many. There was a thread really recently about blacks underperforming compared to other immigrants. OP eventually had his view changed, thanked the person who changed it and said, ""Thanks, I hated feeling like a bigot."""
t3_34s58u,cqxl63p,"If the companies are forthright about the ingredients used in food production/preparation, the nutrition information, and allow the consumer a free choice then the responsibility falls to the consumer to make the correct decisions. If there's no standard serving size, then I grant that it would be up to the consumer to do the math - I feel that it puts people off certain companies, but that's just my experience and what I've heard from a few others. There's the completely separate issue of food companies promoting benefits that the consumer can get from the food without any facts to back it up."
t3_34ew6y,cqu66qp,"I once thought like this - but a girl that I had a relationship with previously had parents that definitely disproved this, though. Something that I didn't see mentioned in the top comments: Many Asian immigrants in the past couple decades have either done so on educations scholarships or because they are business owners (or have the know how to do so) / are well-off. In these cases it may seem like they are coming here with nothing, but, compared to the average population they are much more likely to succeed given their skill set."
t3_34ew6y,cqtzmoj,"If they were going to have an average reaction to those hurdles, they wouldn't have overcome all the extra hurdles that come with immigration, and would still be in their home countries. One big factor to consider is that new immigrants are a highly nonrandom sample. It is really hard to uproot your family and move to a new country."
t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"A lot of people speak perfect english but still frequent people with whom they have another common language and with them they speak that other language (yes even on public transport).

Finally this ""sharia police"" it really isn't a thing."

That means looking towards other methods to pay for schooling that aren't debt (using funds from work, grants, or scholarships), looking into cheap schooling options (testing out of general education or attending community college), and perhaps even responsible loans based on a realistic analysis of your future earning potential.
