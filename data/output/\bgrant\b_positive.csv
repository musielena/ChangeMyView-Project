t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief. In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them. It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over."
t3_2jug85,clf92x6,"Give what you feel you can afford, which from how you describe your circumstances is more than zero. The other compromise to consider is something like Kiva, where you grant micro loans with a 99% payback rate. The -1% interest is only slightly less than you get in a savings account!"
t3_2j28la,cl81bji,"It does not give the government any responsibility for health care. And it does specifically deny the government the right to work on things that it doesn't specifically grant it the right to. So therefore by definition, military is ""ok"" and healthcare is ""not ok""."
t3_2gdd35,cki4q8y,"They often do. But once you grant ""Well ok, pre-marital sex is actually fine"", you undermine the authority that religious texts hold. That's why it normally takes enormous shifts in public opinion for religious leaders to begin adapting."
t3_2fu5da,ckdjfgl,"Of course, whether someone chooses to be gay or is born gay shouldn't matter in how we treat them in day-to-day life. Courts require a higher bar to grant legal privileges and arguing that this characteristic is immutable is the best way to secure those rights. "
t3_2f48co,ck5tk52,"I'm glad you recognize the footing your claim is on. Even if I grant any of the above, how can we say that the government is involved? How can we say that this is an intentional effort to make people stupid, and not just a recognition that this stuff sells very well?"
t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"Because (as far as I know, at least) virtually no one who studies normative ethics would agree to this version of utilitarianism that commits us to kidnapping people and putting them in the experience machine, I believe that it's almost certainly false, at least until I have good reason to think it's true. Okay, that's not something that most of the experts in the field of ethics believe, but grant that it's true. In that case, your view that you want changed amounts to nothing more than ""According to one bizarre theory of ethics that no one takes seriously, kidnapping someone and forcibly connecting them to the experience machine is morally justified."""
t3_2bbyzd,cj3zuoq,"Instead of being a stupid joke? The next most important thing Jar Jar does is make a speech imploring the Senate to grant emergency powers to the Emperor. That's right, instead of making a powerful ""the best of intentions, wait, oh god, what the hell have I done?"
t3_24bof3,ch5k7ny,"It may seem as if its a wasted vote, but should those votes add up enough they do open up doors and possibilities beyond the two party system we have now. Are you aware that should 5% of the population vote 3rd party, that candidate qualifies for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund's grant? This access can greatly expand a candidate's ability to be heard."
t3_20ndjd,cg54ghs,"At this point, we've reduced your claim to something like this: ""Being religious might occasionally make some people more moral."" I'll grant you that. People who behave morally do so for all sorts of reasons, and some of those reasons are probably religious in nature."
t3_20madh,cg4ndzh,"Why though, does the success of one impact the other? Building ten LHC's instead of the ISS would not have discovered 10 particles, and nor would building another ISS instead of the LHC (and other similar projects) grant us much more. "
t3_1zrq6d,cfwi0om,"If we wish to marshal the entire world's scientists in solving our hardest problems (of which we have plenty), then I truly believe we need to abolish this tiered access system, one that exploits public investment for (often) private gain, and level the playing field. Unfortunately, the researchers are getting hit anyway under the traditional model as they either have to get their institutions to shell out several thousands of dollars a year for each site's journal subscription, or else buy several private subscriptions out of one's grant money. I regularly read articles from over twenty different journals."
t3_1y3vw7,cfh6xl3,"You will most likely earn signifcantly more if you remain in college. Further, you have a grant. The only cost for you therefore is the money you're giving up that you would have earned during your time at college."
t3_1s3pxw,cdv43gy,"Not every religious person takes the existence of a god to be self-evident &amp; unquestionable. Also, lets say we grant that you truly never met someone who came to their beliefs with logic. Does that necessarily mean that therefore all religious persons are therefore incapable of rational thought?"
t3_1i3z9w,cb0swyr,"ie. You make a hypothesis, spend tons of effort fighting for grant money, then spend hundreds or thousands of hours in the lab testing it before you have a result. This process is specific to the natural sciences, and is not how research in mathematics works necessarily."
t3_1i3z9w,cb0swyr,"This process is specific to the natural sciences, and is not how research in mathematics works necessarily. In mathematics there is not the same need to fight for grant money because the research is much cheaper. Also, in pure math there is not really any time in a lab testing a hypothesis, rather the emphasis is spent on trying to prove a theorem."
t3_1gjdzq,caks2pc,"Ah, yes and no. The ability to do violence and the monopoly on violence, the ability to kill civilians, to create law and grant exception from it, can all be seen as violence and all contribute to the ""rule of law."" However, once the legitimacy of law has been established through this violence/threat of violence and sovereignty of the state exists, law takes on a different form of reproduction."
t3_1e30x9,c9wfnbb,"Researchers doing basic research often get a much smaller proportion of funding when rated against there contribution. So for someone who graduates with a degree in philosophy and complains that there are no academic jobs available, they could justifiably be claiming that our society has poor values in what they fund just as a scientist who can't get an NIH grant due to cut backs can rightfully complain that society is being short sighted. "
t3_1cbyg8,c9f2fbr,"If that's the claim you want to make, then that's fine, but I could also argue that, if you like. I will grant you that there are a lot of religious people that make the rest of us religious people look bad. It may sound weird, but I'm a Christian who is a big proponent of science."
t3_2ug2wi,co834v1,"entropy), though you mention infinities at some point, which segues into my next point. I will grant you that there are prevailing theories about the infinite nature of the universe and how that can lead to exact duplicates of structures in the universe, and therefore exact copies of yourself. Considering the very nature of infinity, it's impossible for there not to somehow be an atom-for-atom duplicate of yourself, and eventually then for the exact same circumstances of your life to arise."
t3_2t6ote,cnw8hwh,"Presumably nothing. If no ""crime"" took place, why would the courts grant CPS custody? Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it must seem to make reports and nevertheless see these horrible excuses for parents take babies home to what will inevitably amount to shitty home situations."
