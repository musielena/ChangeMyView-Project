t3_2rnr30,cnhlmdo,Where you are able to carry your gun is situational. URL was far more situational that would align with the OP's train of thought. A very long drawn out fire fight where police weren't equipped to deal with the gunmen.
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"At the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject.

t3_2rk7my,cngpiso,"Driving there is a 1 in 1 million chance that you're going to be killed in an accident, maybe a 1 in 10,000 chance that you'll be in an accident at all. You have a strange definition of ""risky""; while it's true a mistake can cost you your life, they often don't (cars have been getting safer since the 1920s) and the fact is that because so many people spend so much time driving, we are better at it than a lot of other things and so are much more likely to not make those mistakes (though, sadly, they do happen). I define ""risky"" as a high likelihood that something out of your control can kill you in the given activity, and the things that can kill you and aren't in your control to some degree in a car are very infrequent."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"I think that people that openly hunt down those they don't agree with online IRL are the reason people use 4chan and other anonymous forums. After a night of drinking even on reddit, I check my comments and prune them accordingly even though I only have a handful of friends that know who I really am. I don't want any of these fascist politically correct fuckbags bothering me IRL."
t3_2r0eyf,cnb8f1r,"Sure, our decisions are the result of physical processes, but why does that make them less meaningful? When I make a choice, I perceive the thought process that leads to it, and I recognise it as my own. A choice is made, and I am the one making it."
t3_2qncj3,cn7wgim,"Then you'll be sent wherever for 5 years (you're an officer, you don't really get any choice... could be Japan, could be Alaska, etc. ), although you might be moved around a bit during those 5 years too, there's no guarantee you'll actually be able to see the world. If you went the civilian route, you'd see as much of the world up to finishing your training, and then you'd have a lot more varied opportunities to see the world."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7kwnd,"I suppose some people might be satisfied with constructing fantasy scenarios with their partner. But it is weakness to post pictures, or weakness to decide that you are too ashamed or worried about consequences to post pictures, even though you want to? Are you saying that it is weakness to want to post pictures in the first place?"
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Also, not only are some applicants bad fits for certain jobs, but some jobs are bad fits for certain applicants. Even if ""networking"" is just the employer telling the applicant about the existence of a job opening that they think would be a good fit has huge effects, without any kind of ""short list"" stuff (although at this point if they stop there, the company is probably knowingly wasting a ton of time and money with their ""weed out"" process on a candidate that they already are pretty sure will at least get an interview). Are you advocating that even this level of networking be discouraged?"
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Lastly, I'm skeptical that ""reducing networking"" will necessarily even help your goals. Although you talk about the cliche schmoozing at networking events style stuff, in my experience real world networking is one of the purest forms of meritocracies out there, as its based very directly on real world performance. But when you fall back to any kind of ""standard process"", I think you underestimate the extent to which such systems can be in a sense ""gamed"" by having the ""right"" sort of resume."
t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"If you want to dispute the advantage that already well-off folks have in resume writing and interviewing on the grounds that these are just skills that anyone could learn, then I feel like you have to acknowledge that networking is also a skill that anyone can learn. That wasn't what I meant though (although that sort of thing does happen and is blatant discrimination). What I meant was that the same underlying reasons why networking ""very clearly favors the already well-off"" as you put it also gives them a comparable advantage in every aspect of the process, including how to write a resume that gets noticed and how to present yourself well in an interview."
t3_2qc1rl,cn50cq3,"3. Which brings me to this point - as you eliminate extremist thoughts, more and more moderate thought begins to be extreme. People will start self-policing their beliefs, and this leads to a loss of freedom."

t3_2q9fkx,cn4ebjb,"In Korea, for example, the year starts in March and ends in December. They didn't need to change the fundamental way everybody had gotten used to reckoning the passage of time, though, in order to achieve this end. That brings me to my main point: everybody is used to the Gregorian calendar."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3ddwl,"This leads to you only being aware of the romantic failings of women - not those of men. Your confirmation bias is that, although someone else here has gotten you to talk about your womanizer friend who is easily as shitty as these women, it hasn't begun the process of changing your view about shitty adult-children being a gendered problem (or maybe it has?). On top of that, because you already have this dim view of women, you weigh their testimony lower than that of men (perhaps also because you have few female friends?"
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her ""seemingly minor"" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu. I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all."
t3_2q5zwb,cn3966e,"I didn't think there was necessarily much more interesting stuff to say about Earth Kingdom politics, the Air Nation's ongoing role, Bolin's love life, etc... Its totally fine that you disagree. If there were more on this, I'd certainly watch it, but I thought I got more than enough closure in these areas. That said, I'm going to focus on: I can't stress enough that I don't understand at all why ""being with someone"" is ""gender roll-y"" or ""non-avatary""."
t3_2q5zwb,cn3966e,"There's a substantial middle ground between ""being a part of the original endgame"" and ""last minute"". Specifically, they thought about it during season one, and then started seriously planning for it and laying the groundwork by the beginning of season 3. Unless you're calling them liars, this has been in the works for years before that final scene."
t3_2q4trg,cn2x9e7,"The religious person loses it and strikes them. I think this deserves some amount of ""heat of the moment"" consideration, even though for most people it would be completely unshocking or even hard to understand (""SO's an atheist, so? divorce him/her and move on"")."

t3_2q2cxc,cn2g775,"Something about one or both of these might allow survival somehow. All of these, though (and, I believe, any other way that humans could survive heat death), rely on physics that we don't understand well enough today to say that we know it's possible. By the physics we know today, it's impossible."
t3_2pxql9,cn1a1iu,"BUT, you do not have a case in saying you can pirate because it infringes on the right of people to develop things on this planet and distribute them how they see fit. We'd have to accept that in your premise that it is okay to pirate because: Even though you may willfully believe that you are compensating the developers purely for a vaguely similar value of the product; that is not what is happening in reality. The agreement and exchange you make involves all of the terms and conditions that they write out for you."
t3_2pp7pp,cmyxcrc,"doesn't really remove comments or posts, except indirectly through the spam filter. The spam filter can be switched off by mods at their own discretion, though, and even those posts/comments which are removed by the filter show up in the mod-queue or spam-trap where mods can manually approve them. That said, here's the main scenarios: ## Posts that are off-topic / break a sub's stated rules About 80% of all manual removals."
t3_2p82u7,cmufwkg,But I'm having trouble attaching moral significance to that. It seems you're saying the moral evaluation of a person or action is merely the degree to which they've thought about their actions and to which their actions align with their thinking. But morality has an entire wing of thinking to it which evaluates actions on their merit as well.
t3_2p82u7,cmufwkg,Surely just the degree of thinking and consistency in actions can't be the only moral criteria you're interested in. It would almost excuse any action by the way a person 'thought' about it. Also a question of practicality: how would others judge this in a person?
t3_2p0lop,cms9kt1,"Elected officials have staff, advisers, experts, and are accountable and in check, not only to their electorate but to the other branches of government. Put in office by people who thought he was the best available person for the position. The same people who would be directly voting on legislation in a direct democracy, you kinda defeated your own point with that one."

t3_2orvv0,cmq18ik,"That clearly isn't true when homosexuality was fairly common in Greece almost 3000 years ago. The other aspect is that ancient Greece is considered to be an advanced society and a civilized culture, and the point there is to suggest that homosexuality isn't something that dooms a culture to fail, when it was accepted in one of the most powerful cultures in history (although I don't think this is a good argument). The other point you brought up with the animals is used as a counter point to the idea that homosexuality is unnatural, not to suggest that animals and their sexual practices are something to strive for."
t3_2orfda,cmpxkl7,"That's clearly level-headed and baldly obvious. It can get tricky, though. Let's run through some situations."
t3_2okad4,cmoaise,And I have never read anything that more accurately captured the dynamics of our families. Even though the parents spend little time on the page I felt they were spot on in every nuanced detail. The relationship between Hazel and her parents was exactly right; I got choked up by Gus's dad and he was barely even a character.
t3_2oihml,cmnioce,"tbh, i'm not sure about C informing B, especially if C doesn't feel morally in the wrong. though they may not morally in the wrong, it's quite ""shitty"" for C to ""backstab"" A. unless A may be potentially dangerous to B (e.g. trying to kill them for the money or to be able to get out of the relationship), there's no reason for C to inform B."
t3_2oihml,cmnj7aa,"due to the lack of standard, i use C's morality as its standard. EDIT: i understand why you can't agree with it though. i personally don't agree with it, but from experience as debater and from meeting different people with different values, i try to see others' point of views and analyse how their values affect their actions."
t3_2o66aa,cmkb48q,"By posting such a judgement on a public forum, they are implicitly looking for reassurance, and it is friendly and polite to reassure them. There are two flaws in this particular example, though I won't necessarily disagree with the basic concept. 1) You're completely ignoring the self-selection effect."
t3_2nz6pz,cmicb4z,"Humans are resilient. Can't really TL;DR this, and i threw together a lot of thoughts without really editing my post well, but the point is, humans have been having kids since forever with uncertain futures, this isn't any different. Humanity wont be wiped off the planet in 50-100 years, but life might not be as simple as it is today."
t3_2nxt7j,cmi1f55,"I'm glad you made that connection for me. Again though, I want to reiterate that defense of property is not, legally, morally or otherwise, justification for ending a human life. The common link here is, of course, the idea that a threat to my life justifies ending yours."
t3_2nvxqw,cmhezg8,"And I genuinely hope it all works out for you both. You don't know it would last, though. That's my only contention."
t3_2nokg9,cmfgdsv,"One would usually argue that 'there is another way' to get to the final result. Also your argument on other's 'rely' on anyone for safety, is a very one sided thought. Whilst it is possible for individuals to 'feel safe' when certain empowered but trusted people lets say police invoke their morality on others lets say thieves as to obtain a sense of safety or justice."
t3_2nid9k,cmdv5rc,"Maybe what you saw was just boring or bad. In another time and place it might be good though because the audience's expectations changes. If we lived in a world where only realistic depictions of things were seen (and written about, etc..) then some nonsense smears might jostle us out of that box."

t3_2nfgyu,cmdb9q0,He said he would get in big trouble if someone did an audit of a hypothetical video recording of this. I still don't think that's reason enough to not have body cams but it was a different cop's perspective that I had not thought of. 
t3_2nccrb,cmcd35f,"We dated other people while maintaining our friendship and never really developed any true feelings for each other outside of friendship.

t3_2n900k,cmld565,"You have to show how the government came to own everything. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction#Corporate_personhood Basically, the government treats corporations as people, even though that's not logical (but the government controls the court system, so legally they're people) I'd like to challenge your belief that a company can become a monopoly by cutting prices way below profit for an extended period of time and recover enough afterward to keep all other potential competitors out. Many people believe this, but we shouldn't base our beliefs on what others think."
t3_2n8psp,cmbzbs2,"In my first marriage I settled. I committed to somebody because I thought I wouldn't do any better, and I was a bit afraid of being alone. It was a bad marriage for 9 years, and she cheated on me."

t3_2lxha7,clz6u94,"How do you think you would feel if your penis had been cut off, you'd been castrated, and you had had a rudimentary vagina created surgically when you were an infant?

t3_2lpxdl,clx2whc,"Just about every major problem in the world is on the decline: poverty, hunger, disease.

t3_2ldxdq,clutbcc,"Good for her because your courage and moral judgement allowed her to fully assess the situation and decide ultimately for herself. Good for you in the long run cause most likely you two have reached that peak in the relationship and if she can't accept who you are, does that mean she didn't love you as much as you thought? I think so!"
t3_2la4jb,clsu6ks,"After all, as long as laziness is the best assumption for why someone did not vote then those who are not voting for a purpose are being effectively silenced. By making every effort to vote you are getting a better representation of the thoughts and feelings of those who do vote (but would not have otherwise) and a better understanding of those who are actively staying home. Voting is communication."
t3_2kypt8,clpzajn,"Kind of like roads in major cities have tools / congestion charges. I think though you're focused on the pricing model and missing the larger issue - that it's time for telecoms to be nationalized in the US.

t3_2jhdaw,clbr1hn,"You know better than I, but my impression is that if the server cannot make at least minimum wage on tips alone, they will be paid that amount anyway by the restaurant. So, you're not actually stiffing them, though I'm sure management will question why they don't get tips and eventually discuss with them their poor behavior and habits.

t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"Sure. It's certainly not easy though. You have to deal with a much much farther starting-point than most, and, to top that off, there are all sorts of obstacles in your way (such as the difficulty in obtaining an education with less money, a legal system that actively makes it harder for you to succeed, a lack of initial capital with which to try new things, the list goes on)."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"which screams ""equality of outcome"" to me, rather than ""equality of opportunity."" This out of the way, though, I shall now address specific points in the above context. Ideally, an egalitarian society would start everyone on the same footing per se, but that does not involve what you're assigning to it."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"If you mean that the same rules would be applied to everyone equally, I'd say that seems fairly obvious. If, though, you mean that ""you get exactly these resources, which are identical to those everyone else gets, no more and no less,"" that seems rather counterproductive; this removes the incentive to advance oneself. More reasonably, it would be ensured that certain provisions were applied equally across society, while starting-point had less of an effect on advancement."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"Basic standards are certainly important, and would go a surprisingly long way to fixing the problems that currently exist. However, what if one of the poorest people in the country was able to receive education, healthcare, and housing, but then lacked the capital to actually patent and start producing this one really brilliant product he thought of? Sure he could try to do such-and-such job until he had enough funds to at least get the patent(supposing food was also supplied) and then turn to crowdfunding, but many ideas require a time of introduction that falls within a narrow window, especially when they aren't patented yet."

t3_2fwmff,ckdfg3r,"There are other factors to consider, such as the cause of the divorce. Before we get to that though, let's talk about the setting. The hypothetical situation I'd like to present will be a couple with two kids, with the husband earning 100% of the pay, and the wife staying home to raise the kids."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"I'm sure she would do some things, but for the sake of the example let's say it was negligible. Beyond that though, the ""violation of the contract"" was that she abandoned the family for another man, which went against her wedding vows which makes the divorce her fault. This should have some bearing on how the money is distributed, especially since she was unfaithful."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"That's why I brought up the drug abuse, because my understanding is that the mother by default gets primary custody unless there is something severely wrong that is well documented, and even then it's apparently a battle for the father of the children to get full custody. In hindsight though, maybe I should have left off any children in this scenario because it does make things a little more grey. The reason I brought them up in the first place was to 1) bring about a feeling of sympathy on your part for the husband, and 2) to steer you toward not being ok with the wife getting 50% of the family's resources."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"However, you could base your decision more from a matter of what class the family was in. These days though, it's much harder to tell what class a person's background in, and even more difficult to tell their earning potential. A single will be able to benefit from free education or affirmative action programs to some degree so in that regard she may have more earnings potential after a divorce."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"I've heard of divorces where alimony and child support end up being higher than 100% of a man's income. Let's pretend the courts are fair though, and if the man abandons the house or is unfaithful, that usually does result in him being punished financially at minimum. I don't think it's a black or white thing, I think there should be discussions, plans for improvement, etc."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"Marriage is more of an emotional thing than a business decision. Actually, I'm not even sure if this applies in law, even though it seems fair, so I can't say that I agree or disagree.

But in 1917 there was a British conquest on Palestine which had many Zionist (Jews) volunteering to help the Brits in their mission but of course this didn't come without opposition, riots broke out in 1920 against the British rule and Jewish migration (though at this time the Jewish population was only around 10 percent, give or take). There were 2 more Aliyahs (migration of Jews into Palestine) between 1919-1929 and then finally in the 1930's the holocaust and Nazism caused a flux of a quarter million Jews to move into Palestine to escape the German ran genocide which caused another revolt in Palestine between 1936 to about 1939 and by the end of WWII, the Jewish population now accounted for about 1/3rd of the population in Palestine."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Now it has degraded even further, the hubris of it all as both sides are so strongly tied to the idea that they are spiritually given the right, as in God is on their side, to win this fight against eachother. It isn't even about the invasion (as some might call it, though I just see it as a sad displacement) from the Jews anymore, but a fanatical idea that God wants them to win and take their land (back), and we know these are pretty theocratic nations so this belief cannot be conquered by simple reason. What a shame."

t3_2c0frm,cjause4,"No, on r/antitheism you aren't going to be downvoted for criticizing popular (the Pope) religious leaders, nor are you going to find love for these people either. It was a topic in the community that r/atheism is at sometimes anti-atheistic and pseudo promoted Islam for a while (although I haven't seen this for a while) and there's little criticism and more so oddly protective of eastern religions. If r/atheism would be renamed to anything, it would be r/antichristianity."

And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss . They may not be more generous than you, but they're still generous."

At first glance, it seems as though it wouldn't be very effective, but it has actually had huge success in reducing homelessness in the state. The reason for this, according to my friend, is that someone can't fail out of the program."

t3_2aotoi,cixbgnz,"The reason they don't want to cover the IUD is because in the event that you do get pregnant on the IUD, it could potentially cause a spontaneous miscarriage, due to a piece of metal/plastic being in the uterus where the baby is growing. This, according to Hobby Lobby, is an abortion, though I do argue with their reasoning behind that. If you look at it, getting pregnant in general can cause a spontaneous miscarriage, if they are trying to eliminate all the things that can cause a miscarriage, then they should just tell people to not get pregnant at all, because honestly every pregnancy could potentially result in a miscarriage."
t3_2aotoi,cixdemv,"Bit hypocritical. I used the Jehovahs witness scenario because that is what the Hobby Lobby case opened up, even though we think its stupid and asinine to think that a religion would deny coverage for something that is life saving (while I agree plan-b isn't) they still now have the OPTION to do it! They could sue, and possibly win, weather we think its a good thing or not."

When a thoughtful critic says he enjoyed a movie, he is not saying the same thing as when he calls it great. Just so, many people do in fact merely mean that they didn't like a movie when they call it overrated."

Winston ""loved Big Brother"" at the end of 1984 because he had been tortured and psychologically damaged to the point that he was no longer capable of forming rational thoughts. The word ""love"" is perhaps misappropriated in this sense, because what Winston was suffering from at this stage was more like an advanced Stockholm Syndrome, whereby his own capability for free thinking and intelligence was crushed, such that he could be brainwashed into feeling allegiance to the state and have all other pleasures in life (the ability to think for himself, a sense of individual identity, his love for Julia) forcibly destroyed."

She would look thoughtful and contemplative -- exactly the sort of character qualities that I loved about her. Her smoking was a welcome pause from a night stuck to the sofa to open the window, feel the breeze and look up at the stars."
t3_1l39f3,cbvdl8d,"They were being told by their commanders that the casualties were expected to be ridiculously high and that they all only had a small chance of survival. The soldiers looked around to their comrades and thought to themselves ""I feel sorry for the poor bastards who are going to die"". The point is that the same thing that made the soldiers think everyone else was going to die makes young people think they aren't going to be the ones to die from lung cancer."

Although, as you say, life continued during previous mass extinctions, by definition much of life did not survive. If we lose enough supporting species, it is possible that human life could end, and likely that humanity would be negatively impacted (by loss of food sources, sources of new drugs, etc)."
t3_1kzxcm,cbuiv91,"But I know that every day that I look at it, I'll be reminded of the love and sacrifice my SO and I shared, and I won't regret it. To be fair, I never thought I wanted a diamond engagement ring. When my then-girlfriend was considered proposing, she asked me what I wanted and what I cared about."
t3_1kzxcm,cbuiv91,"It's much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother. The problem is, even though it's brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is. Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time."

The reason it seems like such a dramatic change, IMHO, is twofold."
t3_1kr8vj,cbru1c0,"The whole speech about broken men given by that guy she's travelling with (his name escapes me at the moment) is pretty damn fantastic.

t3_1kkvd3,cbpzant,"A building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum.

t3_1kkvd3,cbqba5y,"Of course, what they pictured was perhaps further attacks on US bases in the mid east, or at worst, a repeat of the 1993 WTC bombing (which left 6 people dead). What happened, though, was that the terrorists came up with a plan that's brilliance was how amateur it was. Truthers act like there's no way these guys could have pulled something like that off, which strikes me as ludicrous, they believe that the government is capable of faking the whole thing in a giant, extremely convoluted plan, but the idea of breaking into an airplane cockpit with box cutters and taking control of a plane is implausible?"
t3_1kkvd3,cbqba5y,"Airplanes have been hijacked hundreds of times, so that's hardly new, and the idea of using a plane as a weapon is pretty old too, dating back at least to kamikaze pilots, and probably earlier.

t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"I may be wrong but I'm fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent. I know I would be weary to hit a woman who hit me since I would perceive it as wrong, even though logically that makes no sense. This might not be about gender roles and just about justice porn (we even have a subreddit for it) which reddit loves like /u/BenIncognito points out, but you don't even have to agree with that."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"That is true, and it is sad. However the reality is since the majority of the reddit population is male this is a more cathartic experience to them given they have experience this double standard in real life, so that although entertaining the same situation with the genders reversed would not give everyone the same tingly feeling. This isn't a good thing by any means, but I don't know if we could argue it indicates a loss of understanding of what reality is."

t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But if I could afford a smartphone, I'd buy one, if I didn't already have a tablet (it was a gift). My mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) I gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But when she went back to our home country (splits her year between america and our home country because she has young grand children there), my brother didn't know how to use linux so he replaced it with windows for her. So the computer became a fucking mess even though all she does is read and watch news! Not to mention she hates windows because it's so difficult to use, and she misses linux :P Anyway, the computer becoming a mess is not a problem with an android/iphone, anyone who's used them once can use it anytime again in any other device."

When a friend said they'd buy me a tablet, I thought the same as you and tried to convince him how stupid tablets are and that I don't want him to waste his money on one for me! Specially as I'm a linux tweaking freak who customizes everything little detail for her needs, and with a tablet I have very little choice on customization."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"I mostly agree with you, but it's important to remember that ""human morality"" both contains rules/guidelines about what we can morally do (that is, what rights other beings have), and what we should do. Thus, even though I agree that animals don't have rights because we have no reason to restrict ourselves in our dealings with them, in certain cases it is still in our self-interest to not treat them poorly - not out of consideration for them, but out of consideration for ourselves. Specifically, though factory farming and such are fine even when they cause animal suffering, it is because the suffering isn't the goal but an undesirable yet acceptable side effect of the real goal, which is relatively inexpensive food."

t3_1kcow1,cbnlbww,"The Democrats believed that the Federal Government had the capacity to be just as bad as the oppression of the British Monarchy/Parliament. They wanted things to be locally-based and thought that the best vision for society where the locals know what's best for themselves - not some far off stuffy institution in Washington, Philadelphia or New York. In a way they were looking out for the common man - it was almost proto-marxist in a sense."
t3_1kcow1,cbnlbww,"The South dominated the Federal Government and aimed to keep things local - not just for slavery, but because even if you are against slavery as some southerners were, you believe that's the best way to run a government. I think it's possible that a lot of southerners still believe this today, even though they may not be aware that it came from Jefferson and Democrats. Have you ever heard that the South was a Democrat holdout for a long time - well into the 1900s?"
t3_1kcow1,cbnlbww,"So therefore, children should be taught that if you really want to adopt the early Jeffersonian approach, you have to spend a lot more time being politically active and ensuring that your society is safe, and you have to be well-politically educated, respect public opinion and look out for the common good beyond your own immediate needs. But ultimately they are being taught the States Rights' thing probably because it fits more in line with southern Republican thought (I'm speculating here). It probably isn't specifically used to oppress black people, it's used to educate voters from a young age, the same way that Democrats do that in states where they dominate."
t3_1kcow1,cbnluty,"As much as we hate slavery today, I think in the early 1800s white people didn't see it as that bad. The vast majority really thought that black people were pretty much just animals. As horrible as that sounds, that's how it was."

t3_1kbeez,cbn9zoq,"I'm pleased that you make a distinction between mainstream pornography and any pornographic material, as most people I see arguing this don't seem to do so at all. I disagree that these are problems directly related to pornography, though. As far as the first two points, is this really something we can pin directly on this pornography, or is it more indicative of a general societal problem where men are valued above women, particularly in the realm of sexuality?"
t3_1kag5w,cbn17ww,"I don't think we have sufficient evidence to rule out either view, so the question becomes a matter of what kind of world you want to live in, and how these views influence how you live your life. The idea of determinism regarding consciousness is, I believe, based on the idea that people are seemingly given distinct choices, and that they seem to choose one path or another - though really, their choice was based entirely off of previous actions, and so is not really a choice at all. As an alternative model, perhaps it is possible that there aren't really choices in the way that we think of them."

t3_1ka1tu,cbmvpoo,Footage of gay pride parades is often used by conservatives to discredit the gay rights movement. Even though this position makes intuitive sense we can see that very public very unpopular (with the majority) demonstrations seem to work to move issues forward.

t3_1it8ez,cb7ufo1,"It is more than likely that an anti-Israeli terrorist would be an Arab, but you can't lay down a similar hard and fast rule concerning an American criminal. We justify racial profiling by saying that a person with a specific characteristic is individually more likely to have committed a crime, though crime is not primarily committed by those with that characteristic.

t3_1gqfyr,camr1ip,"We invaded Iraq under the (false) pretense that they had weapons of mass destruction and were planning on using them. 9/11 was not the primary reason for the invasion, though feelings of patriotism and anti-islamic sentiment that were leftover from 9/11 may have made us more receptive to the invasion. That particular disaster happened two years prior to our invasion of Iraq."
t3_1gndd7,caly3r9,"You have yet to give me a good reason why the fact that science proves materialism affects the answers of any of these questions. For example, there are plenty of philosophers of mind who believe that consciousness cannot be replicated, even though they are materialists. Your view, while it seems to make the most sense, is also the least reflective."
t3_1gndd7,cam0we6,"Then again, your response sounds like Daniel Dennett's, who argues that if such P-Zombies had no qualia, including the experience of pain, it would most certainly change their behavior and thus they wouldn't act identically to human beings. But I think the point of the thought experiment is that the zombie mimics human behavior perfectly, but doesn't have conscious qualia. Such a thing could be imagined, as run in a sufficiently advanced computer."
t3_1gndd7,cam0we6,"The problem is that instead of starting from some kind of simplistic faith and having the great thinkers doubt and challenge accepted viewpoints, everybody these days starts with doubt. The issue is that we still associate this simplistic doubt with intelligence and thoughtfulness as if faith was still where everybody started and doubt is a major move. So this creates an awkward dynamic where everybody takes certain things as assumptions, but then claims that these assumptions are the result of scientific progress and doubting what is accepted."

t3_1g912k,cai00qt,"A woman's career choices can be affected by the judgments she expects from people. Even a simple ""I want to help people"" thought can automatically and unconsciously lead to teaching or nursing for a woman and being a doctor for a man. This is because of the lack of stereotype-breaking role models in children's lives."
t3_1g912k,cai00qt,Additionally you fail to ask why all those traditionally female roles are less well-paid. Teachers' pay is set centrally so it's not just the market (although if something is caused by the market that doesn't mean it's not caused by the patriarchy too). Why do we value things women want to do less than we value things men want to do?
t3_1g8dms,cahrjrv,"The Theory of Moral Sentiments By Adam Smith is one of my favorite reads of all time because of it's sophistication and the ideas presented that are still relevant today. I particularly remember in part of the book where he talks about how people feel bad sentiments towards those who laugh too hard at a joke, and I don't know why that stuck with me, I just thought it was interesting that human nature, at least in social dialogues, hasn't changed much since the 18th century. The book also is a great teacher of vocabulary and just delivers great ideas on a lot of different social issues."

t3_1fm8eb,cabo09i,"The relevant difference with pedophilia is that children cannot give consent, whilst incest between parents and their chilren (including adult children) involves a power differential in the same way a teacher-student sexual relationship does. Homosexual relationships do not by definition include non-consenting individuals or power differentials (although some of them certainly can have these features). And yes I realise I haven't excluded sibling incest because to be honest the only reason I can see as to why this should be sanctioned is because of the genetic risk to potential children, so I guess if they use preventative measures its ok."
t3_1fkqyp,cab7rfj,"This is true of all moral dilemmas. You may say, though, the problem is that the parents are effecting someone other than themselves, which is true.

t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"For example if something in formal logic done by somebody who is both a mathematician and a philosopher, is useful in mathematics, that can hardly be said to be a result from philosophy used in mathematics, since for this purpose 'philosophical logic' and 'mathematical logic' are basically the same field. What you can say is that formal logic is useful in (the rest of) mathematics (though it is easy to overestimate this, centuries of mathematical discoveries were made just fine without any formal foundation, and even nowadays most mathematicians consider set theorists to be mostly irrelevant). I was thinking exactly the same, but the opposite."

Also, academic indications like GPA and school placement are only measures of your technical performance."

t3_18hfbb,c8f4pon,If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production.

However, as with cars, if you fail to properly transfer ownership of a gun and that gun is used in a crime, there should probably be some consequences for you, though obviously not as severe as for the person who actually perpetrated the crime.

Labels are important, though, as you have shown in your post - the feminist label used by the activists for these things you take issue with seems to be at the root of your attitude towards feminism. Because of that, I would recommend that you renounce your label of anti-feminist, in the interest of pursuing an egalitarian agenda."

t3_33x4zd,cqph109,"With respect to your examples, getting into a head on collision with a drunk driver is bad, this is true, but you accepted the risk of other drivers when you chose to drive, therefore you engaged in a risky proposition (driving) and were unlucky enough to encounter a bad situation (drunk driver). Cancer is thought to be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors, so even rare forms of cancer have to do with you participating in modern society with its associated carcinogens in the air we breathe, the foods we eat and the liquids we drink. Granted the chance of any of these things is lower than when you engage in things such as diving, sky diving etc, but its more of an issue of the likelihood of something happening, not that driving, or living in a city is completely devoid of risk."

t3_33jriw,cqlrxku,"There are people who still have Holocaust survivors in their families - there are people whose parents lost their entire family. Knowing that your family was exterminated because people hated them that much for being Jewish is a pretty terrible thought to grow up with as a Jew, and trauma and stress about something actually can be passed from generation to generation. Not to mention, neo-nazis and the like still exist - Jewish people all over the world are still discriminated against to large degrees, and since our worst case scenario already happened, we feel like we have to be cautious at all times and remind people that what happened was serious and had long-lasting impact that still isn't healed (there are still a lot less Jews than there were before the Holocaust, for example)."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"I think I can at least explain everything you've got a concern or problem with on the Holocaust front (I don't know enough about other genocides, etc to comment on those, to be honest), even if I don't quite end up changing your view. Hopefully I will, though. When I say that in the eyes of many Jewish people, the world has proven to us that it wants us dead, it's less about that being totally accurate and more about that it's a pretty natural reaction to finding out all the atrocities that have been committed against us."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"So adding the Holocaust to that can stir up some pretty sad and strong feelings about how people feel about Jews, and lots of us can't help but feel protective and like we are being targeted even today in areas that we are relatively safe in. I do think that even though we may be aware that the whole world doesn't actually want us dead, many of us are certainly afraid that someday, that sentiment will become popular (again-ish), and personally, I can't fault anyone for fearing that. Yeah, I don't think a conversation about freedom of speech has to include a long list of everyone in someone's Jewish family who died, but I do think if we're talking about the nastiness of Holocaust denial and anti-semitism (I hope you don't mind that I'm continuing to use that word - I prefer it over anti-Judaism because discrimination against Jews is at least partially due to our ethnicity, rather than our primary religion) it's relevant for a Jewish person to bring up their own history or experiences with it, even if it's not something that ""directly"" happened to them."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"People often resort to personal stories when discussing controversial subjects. Sometimes people do stick things in where they don't belong, though.

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"Like, we stepped in and saved the Jews! But we never learned in my classes, for example, that the US turned away many, many Jews trying to escape the Holocaust, even though the immigration quota was nowhere near filled for most of the war. They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went.

t3_320cdd,cq6tjhk,"And hyperbole is targeted at peoples' emotions. Likewise, when trying to ""reason"" with a person who holds an unreasonable position, logic and thoughtful argument doesn't often work. Mockery and shame is a time-tested tactic."
t3_320cdd,cq6tjhk,"Liberals use these techniques as well, recently evidenced by the current ""anti-vaxxer"" arguments online - anyone who expresses concern over vaccinations is often personally attacked and publicly humiliated. Do these things tend to polarize and exclude people from thoughtful debate and compromise? I think yes, in some cases, but I think in other cases there is also evidence that trying to reason with an unreasonable person is an exercise in futility -- and in those cases, more hyperbolic engagement does make a difference."

t3_2z2msj,cpf7g2a,"A lot like I/ITSEC, if anyone has gone to that. Although, of course, on a much smaller scale. Our gaming foundations teacher got a hold of a dev kit Occulus Rift for this event, and was showing it off."
t3_2z2msj,cpf7g2a,"And having worn an Occulus, I can say that we are very close to them being perfect. Here's the thing though... people are expecting it to revolutionize gaming, and on its own VR is not going to do that. Not at all."
t3_2z2e9y,cpf8cro,"And since we don't talk about sex openly, people only hear about how gross feet are- not how sexy they are. I always thought that foot fetishes were hugely common. I personally find feet to be horribly disgusting for some inexplicable reason."
t3_2yszp3,cpcuf7e,"Not to mention that global population is estimated to begin decreasing soon... Although your intentions are good, your priorities are morally perverse to the extreme. All around the world people are clawing their way out of extreme poverty, starvation and misery."
t3_2yrv0y,cpck14d,"My guest bathroom without a shower on the ground floor is like this. In some college dorms, they have many of these bathrooms (though each has a shower). These are referred to as ""gender neutral"" and mean that a floor can be co-ed, as opposed to barrack style high capacity bathrooms, which are at present separated by gender."
t3_2yrog1,cpcpdf3,"I think there are very few heavily armed criminal gangs active in the US, and that police should stop pretending they face them with any regularity. The police have excessively militarized (I'd stop short of saying they've quite declared martial law though) and I would like to oppose that. No-knock raids should be eliminated."
t3_2yrgi3,cpcbda3,"This is a fair possibility, but one that can be cut down on with condoms, birth control, and even abortions. Inevitably the situation you describe would happen though. It is a disadvantage to hiring women."
t3_2y2x3h,cp5u0ky,"In fact, it seems like a lot of fast food places already do this and it doesn't seem to deter people who frequent there. Well, it is an intrusion on freedoms though. Just because you don't agree with the consequences of their decisions doesn't mean that it's not impacting their freedom."
t3_2y2tk3,cp5x9us,"It is mostly fluff and misses a lot of important nuances, but it conveys the general concept. I agree that it is reasonable to allow rhetorical wiggle room for people making this statement even though it misses a lot of nuances of the issue. The statement that ""Darren Wilson is a monster"" or is guilty etc."
t3_2y1qef,cp5h19u,"The arguments against mandatory childhood vaccination can come from valid opinions that the government shouldn't force medical treatment onto someone who doesn't want it, even if it's for the good of society, but that's a subjective argument that just comes down to how you feel about the issue. Regarding the science, though, the evidence is crystal-clear. Yes, hygiene and clean water are hugely important, and that's why we continue to promote those as well, but there is very clear evidence supporting the idea that vaccinations cause dramatic differences in the rate of these diseases."
t3_2y1qef,cp5hsqg,"It's just a different place to draw the line. Well, as I said, it's a purely personal stance, but I'm pretty libertarian, so I take the side of no, the government should not be forcing people to do anything to themselves against their will, even though it's very clearly beneficial for society as a whole. Others will have different opinions, and I can't say they're wrong."
t3_2xucsd,cp40o0d,"If The Child isnt able to meet deadlines, will they see themselves as Failures and waste of space?

t3_2xnzkl,cp1snca,"Well you are basically saying an alternative to Capitalism is going to interest you, because Capitalism is flawed. I'd ask you though, what about the costs of taking on those other ideologies. Being different doesn't mean better, and I'm hard-pressed to see how any of those ideologies would fix the issues you have with Capitalism."
t3_2xnzkl,cp1snca,From your title (but you haven't said much to defend it) you are saying that if we want to fix the extremist problem we need to fix Capitalism. This thought isn't all that wrong. It is based on the premise that those choosing extremism are doing so because Capitalism has failed them.
t3_2xnzkl,cp1snca,It is based on the premise that those choosing extremism are doing so because Capitalism has failed them. I'd ask you to defend that claim though. I would argue that more people are drawn to Extremism due to other motives.

t3_2x8z4g,coxyxff,"Yes, there are times when it may be morally right to not try to convince people not to commit suicide, such as when they have a terminal condition and killing themselves would help ease the pain. If a person has also thought long and hard in a rational and lucid state, then perhaps it may not be morally wrong to stop them either. Unfortunately most suicides stem from panic and a sense of failure about a current situation, instead of absolute certainty or other solutions."
t3_2wt9ya,cotx5b0,"You see that jailing those guilty of no crime is wrong. It is objectively wrong, even though you live in a time and place where it is morally acceptable. And that you can't go there suggests you know there is some objective morality."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"I prefer to talk in terms of whether or not behavior was moral. People are generally not evil, in the sense that they seek to do wrong, but they are often immoral, in the sense that they do wrong even though that is not their goal. But, yes, immoral actions are immoral whether or not you know they are immoral."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"But, whether or not they knew it, it was wrong. I feel very comfrotable saying that Nazis operating the death camps who thought they were behaving morally and who were part of a time and place that saw their behavior as moral, were behaving immorally. Despite the fact that they didn't know they were."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"Absolutely. Even those who thought they were doing the right thing. Because sometime people are wrong, and are behaving immorally without knowing it."
t3_2wj2qe,corcu44,"Evo psych never claimed this either, mainly because natural selection is not a personified force, so it can not ""strive"". Natural selection does affect mating strategies though, because choosing the wrong partner lowers the chances of the offspring's survival. This is why male instincts try to impregnate every women (best strategy for maximizing the number of descendants) while female instincts try to ensure that only the best male candidates (with the highest survival potential) can impregnate the female."
t3_2wh592,coqt473,"I'd say that's because a lot of men have never been in that situation, so for them it would be refreshing. It isn't just a matter of a one time compliment though. This is a video showing what this woman goes through in ONE day."
t3_2wh592,coqt473,You're tired of only being acknowledged because of the way you look. It can make you feel as though there's nothing more to you than your body. These random guys are treating you like you're a walking piece of meat or art.
t3_2wh592,coqt473,"Suddenly this guy is calling you a bitch or a cunt because you didn't stop to thank him or talk to him. He feels as though by him pointing out something about your physical appearance, you owe him gratitude and acknowledgement. If you don't give him that, then you are no longer beautiful, you're a bitch."
t3_2wcx6l,copoa4v,"The successful campaigns are the ones selling products, not begging for money so they can start a business. That's how it works though. I bought a game off Kickstarter the other day."
t3_2vzx7m,comd7eb,"Then it might be beneficial to go to a group of people that think the same as you do, or have experienced the same things. This is more about the fact that there are legitimate reasons to go to atheist conventions though.

t3_2vxd18,colrkuv,"Pro athletes are the heart of billion dollar industries, their pay is Representative of that.

t3_2vsa6d,cokgyrt,"Some families have rules like ""no politics at family gatherings"" and there's sometimes a taboo about discussing them in social situations, so I don't think what you're mentioning is unique to online posts - it's just that what we but online is broadcast, vs the direct face-to-face communication that is the norm. I think your argument that discussing politics is a lose-lose idea is poor in both cases, though - because the alternative to discussing them among friends is letting a conversation among media figures to take place of our own conversation. I would much prefer to live in a place with robust public debate and discussion than one where speaking out is seen as ""weird"" and isolates the speaker."
t3_2vrkd8,cokg2if,"There still is a significant portion of unknown and we have to accept the methodology but it definitely can give us an order of magnitude (i.e: you would see a difference between 0.1%, 1%, 10% or 90% false accusations rates but you wouldn't be able to say what percentage it is exactly). Another approach, that is needed to have pertinent statistics, is to try to find the same informations though indirect means. For example if you know that last year 100 rapes happened and that 50 rapes were unreported (again getting this information is hard) and there was 60 rape accusations you know that 10 of them were false without knowing which ones."
t3_2vks7u,coim6rj,If you want to get in on just the strength of academics you have to try that much harder. The same is true of sports though. B list athletes don't get into Harvard just cause they joined the football team for a lark.
t3_2vayhb,cog18c4,"So, it didn't matter so much that Sid Vicious couldn't play bass. What mattered was that his name was F'n Sid Vicious and he didn't care what anyone thought (at least that's the image they sold). Personally, I think the Ramones wrote some seriously impressive hooks that will stand the test of time forever, but that's a matter of taste."
t3_2v7lcq,cof892z,"MLK is respected because of his message and his ideas , not because of the way he dressed , and certainly not because of his skin color .

t3_2uudze,cobzyv2,"I play Melee competitively, and that's a huge portion of my life. I've been playing for about a year and a half and I've put a great amount of effort into this game (Likely somewhere to the tune of 500 hours, and I've thought about it and talked to people from the scene many many orders more than that), so if I see someone that plays Candy Crush on their morning commute call themselves a gamer, they might not be wrong , but identifying as a gamer is a way to identify yourself as an active partaker in a hobby. If I'm a player of Magic the Gathering, and say I'm a Magic Player, people that are also Magic players are more likely to jump onto that and ask ""Oh, What deck do you play?"
t3_2unkg9,coa3lkt,"It's this view of science, and the PC view of social discourse which are limiting the spectrum of debate and discouraging intellectual advancement and the introduction of new ideas and perspectives. This has already been said, but I need to reiterate, these ideas are one point on a very slippery slope to censorship, the loss of free speech, and thought crime. The idea that someone should not be heard because an intellectual community considers them to be wrong would have prevented the enlightenment, spurned the free thought in Athens which led to great thinkers such as plato and Aristotle, and would have made the cultural changes of the last 100 years go much slower."

t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"But as u/Account9726 mentioned, French cuisine has made some major contributions to other countries' daily cooking, so it is not always easy to notice. I think high end restaurants are not a good representation of French food (although they are part of it). I would look instead at what is commonly available at the supermarket and the marketplace."
t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"This, to me, shows how ""French cuisine offers the most creative and adventurous use of ingredients, has the widest variety of ingredients and flavors"" as u/nwf839 described it. The quality of the average ingredient and the dishes you find in a common french restaurant (not big chains, although they are not too bad either) are often of good quality. Of course that is also the case for Italian food, but France offers most diversity with comparable quality."

t3_2sqh6c,cns23nc,"I haven't seen this addressed yet, but I think that you're missing the basic point of why racism is bad. It's bad because it's making a generalization about some group of people, and then applying, in words and actions, that generalization to members of the group as though there were some kind of causal relationship between statistical definitions of groups and individuals. Observing that black people in America have a statistically higher crime rate isn't any more of an issue than observing that people with ghetto culture have a statistically higher crime rate."
