t3_2pxql9,cn1a1iu,We'd have to accept that in your premise that it is okay to pirate because: Even though you may willfully believe that you are compensating the developers purely for a vaguely similar value of the product; that is not what is happening in reality.

t3_2jgtvo,clbm2rj,I think you're ignoring the other side of it though.

t3_2ixatz,cl6g9da,"At this point let's bring back in my first reason- we haven't yet found any evidence that intelligent life exists anywhere but here on earth so the likely hood of any aliens coming from a nearby star is incredibly low, otherwise we would have seen evidence of their existence before now- though I do admit it's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, the same odds are against the hopeful invaders."
t3_2ir1vh,cl4qfr4,"Even though feminists would describe themselves as egalitarian, if egalitarian is a blanket term that describes both feminists and MRA folks who they strongly disagree with, its not a useful term to distinguish feminists from others who are in practice hold very different views."

t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"This out of the way, though, I shall now address specific points in the above context."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"If, though, you mean that ""you get exactly these resources, which are identical to those everyone else gets, no more and no less,"" that seems rather counterproductive; this removes the incentive to advance oneself."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrhavj,"It seems like there's still strategizing (though with less time to think about it), and there's still the kinds of skills you mention (except it doesn't sound to me like there's as much specialization in rugby, so these are skills that most of the players have the learn, not just a few of them)."

t3_2gly57,ckkjp8m,"In short, I'll put it this way, if we did trade with them, I could see it being much like Laos, in that you don't see too many naive westerners defending Lao's current system of government, even though they're also socialist."

t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"In hindsight though, maybe I should have left off any children in this scenario because it does make things a little more grey."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"These days though, it's much harder to tell what class a person's background in, and even more difficult to tell their earning potential."

t3_2f8s0s,ck7aczu,"I won't go into all the reasons for and against (though I'll mention that poverty rates have stagnated after implementing our ""War on Poverty"", and they were drastically declining prior,) because they are all very complicated, and there are thoughtful voices on both sides of the debate."

t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"But in 1917 there was a British conquest on Palestine which had many Zionist (Jews) volunteering to help the Brits in their mission but of course this didn't come without opposition, riots broke out in 1920 against the British rule and Jewish migration (though at this time the Jewish population was only around 10 percent, give or take)."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"It isn't even about the invasion (as some might call it, though I just see it as a sad displacement) from the Jews anymore, but a fanatical idea that God wants them to win and take their land (back), and we know these are pretty theocratic nations so this belief cannot be conquered by simple reason."
t3_2c0gpr,cjaq908,They most likely do drive on a daily basis though.
t3_2byn0m,cjabwg5,Kind of like in math class you study calculus even though the laws of physics are more important/relevant.

t3_2bag31,cj3f08t,"And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss ."
t3_2ba26t,cj3fcgi,"For example, some video game magazines and websites use 10 point reviewing schemes -- but very often they will not rate a game that is ""acceptable"" as any lower than a 7, even though the numbers suggest that a 5-6 would be ""acceptable."""

t3_2av5cs,ciz33th,"At first glance, it seems as though it wouldn't be very effective, but it has actually had huge success in reducing homelessness in the state."

t3_2atkq9,cizde8p,"It is pretty hard to come up with one line examples of irony that work in a song though, so it's not really Alanis' fault."

t3_2aotoi,cixdemv,"I used the Jehovahs witness scenario because that is what the Hobby Lobby case opened up, even though we think its stupid and asinine to think that a religion would deny coverage for something that is life saving (while I agree plan-b isn't) they still now have the OPTION to do it!"

t3_2a9dnv,cissjh9,"Seriously, though, you've given three reasons why a person won't know how to pronounce a word properly and none of them indicate ignorance or lack of intelligence in my opinion: If it's a word from a language that died before humanity invented reliable means of recording sounds, NO ONE can say for sure what it sounded like."

t3_29r85r,cinqid2,"If it did though, if the world worked that way, I would rather have the box opened that could lead to more individual freedom from governmental power, than the box that would be opened with an opposite ruling: opening the door for the government to impose laws on anyone regardless of their ideological stances."
t3_29pjwk,cin94yc,"For example, if I note that everyone born prior to, say, 1850 was human and died, and then infer from this that all humans will eventually die, I have not appealed to any authority even though I have made an inductive inference."

t3_29n4wo,cimqk8p,"She fits all of these expectations even I personally was beginning to think might be a bit too ridiculous, from a person who was ""Christian gone agnostic"" to ""at least a 6/10"" to ""doesn't want to live in the city, even though we currently live in the city."""

t3_27r91j,ci4g5dm,"I'm a smoker, and I'd like to quit (although I haven't tried hard lately), though the loss of the social opportunities presented as the result of stepping outside the bar or party to have a cigarette are insane."
t3_27qqap,ci3fwt5,"That seems to be in tension with your claim that we should have universal healthcare, though, because universal healthcare requires taking huge sums of money from some people to give to others, which arguably violates the rights of the people who earned the money."

t3_1c11cx,c9cjvuj,"Ultimately, though (and I recognise that I've written a lot tonight) my objection to your plan lies in the fact that you're taking a positive freedom (the health benefit and disability benefit), and holding it hostage in exchange for the weight loss program."

t3_1b4ngo,c93juyb,"Even though you might make foolish decisions while drunk, it is ultimately your responsibility to control and moderate what enters your body and how that affects your decision making."
t3_1b4ngo,c93juyb,"This is because though you might not have been in the right state to make a proper decision in that moment, you could have easily prevented it."

t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"In practice though, it's a very different story, you just have to look at the last few governments record of subtle privatisation and reduced service."
t3_33xvlb,cqpfr89,"The problem arises, though, that if you treat ""best"" strictly as a subjective term in that way, it is by definition impossible to create a best game, and therefore a best game will never be created, either in the past, present, or future."

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"I do think that even though we may be aware that the whole world doesn't actually want us dead, many of us are certainly afraid that someday, that sentiment will become popular (again-ish), and personally, I can't fault anyone for fearing that."

t3_2y1qef,cp5hsqg,"Well, as I said, it's a purely personal stance, but I'm pretty libertarian, so I take the side of no, the government should not be forcing people to do anything to themselves against their will, even though it's very clearly beneficial for society as a whole."

t3_2uk6fx,co9o182,"This data is unfortunately not conclusive, and known issues are that the transgendered persons were taking estrogen, which may have impacted results, the sample size of 6 is small (though let's be fair, autopsies of the brains of the transgendered who have donated their body to science are probably not that common), and the sexual dimorphism does not appear until adulthood, well after transgendered identity does (though that seems to me an argument that they share a causal factor, rather than an argument for it's all a coincidence)."
t3_2uh710,co8ynyz,the idea that you shouldn't have kids if you can't afford to give them a cell phone is a bit extreme though.
