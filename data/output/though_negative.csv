t3_2pxql9,t3_2pxql9,We'd have to accept that in your premise that it is okay to pirate because: Even though you may willfully believe that you are compensating the developers purely for a vaguely similar value of the product; that is not what is happening in reality.

t3_2hevmr,t3_2hevmr,"This out of the way, though, I shall now address specific points in the above context."
t3_2hevmr,t3_2hevmr,"If, though, you mean that ""you get exactly these resources, which are identical to those everyone else gets, no more and no less,"" that seems rather counterproductive; this removes the incentive to advance oneself."
t3_2hcsbm,t3_2hcsbm,"It seems like there's still strategizing (though with less time to think about it), and there's still the kinds of skills you mention (except it doesn't sound to me like there's as much specialization in rugby, so these are skills that most of the players have the learn, not just a few of them)."

t3_2c1mga,t3_2c1mga,"It isn't even about the invasion (as some might call it, though I just see it as a sad displacement) from the Jews anymore, but a fanatical idea that God wants them to win and take their land (back), and we know these are pretty theocratic nations so this belief cannot be conquered by simple reason."

t3_2bag31,t3_2bag31,"And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss ."
t3_2ba26t,t3_2ba26t,"For example, some video game magazines and websites use 10 point reviewing schemes -- but very often they will not rate a game that is ""acceptable"" as any lower than a 7, even though the numbers suggest that a 5-6 would be ""acceptable."""

t3_2aotoi,t3_2aotoi,"I used the Jehovahs witness scenario because that is what the Hobby Lobby case opened up, even though we think its stupid and asinine to think that a religion would deny coverage for something that is life saving (while I agree plan-b isn't) they still now have the OPTION to do it!"
t3_2ao6r9,t3_2ao6r9,"Saying ""*Citizen Kane* is overrated because I like Star Wars more"" is a bad criticism though, you're right on that point."

t3_2a9dnv,t3_2a9dnv,"Seriously, though, you've given three reasons why a person won't know how to pronounce a word properly and none of them indicate ignorance or lack of intelligence in my opinion: If it's a word from a language that died before humanity invented reliable means of recording sounds, NO ONE can say for sure what it sounded like."

t3_29t2lw,t3_29t2lw,"Your hypothetical is also flawed because it makes it seem as though the appropriate response from a woman confronted with a significantly lower salary (presumably for no other reason than that she is a woman, although your hypothetical doesn't specify if this is the case) than the minimum compensation of what this position should command is to shrug it off and try to find better pay elsewhere."

t3_29r85r,t3_29r85r,"If it did though, if the world worked that way, I would rather have the box opened that could lead to more individual freedom from governmental power, than the box that would be opened with an opposite ruling: opening the door for the government to impose laws on anyone regardless of their ideological stances."
t3_29pjwk,t3_29pjwk,"For example, if I note that everyone born prior to, say, 1850 was human and died, and then infer from this that all humans will eventually die, I have not appealed to any authority even though I have made an inductive inference."
