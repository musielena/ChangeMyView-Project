t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Although you talk about the cliche schmoozing at networking events style stuff, in my experience real world networking is one of the purest forms of meritocracies out there, as its based very directly on real world performance."

t3_2jpazx,cldtw4w,"Now, perhaps there may be credence to an individual committing these acts for the fame and noteriety (although since many mass shooters die in the attack I don't know how well we could scientifically test state of mind and whether reduced news coverage would actually serve as a catalyst for reduced mass shooting events) and perhaps we can say a media ban of coverage would be best for society as a whole."
t3_2jkgzi,clcw0hv,"The idea is that you are trying reactions you wouldn't have thought of before because, frankly, based on what we know they are kind of silly."

t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"If, though, you mean that ""you get exactly these resources, which are identical to those everyone else gets, no more and no less,"" that seems rather counterproductive; this removes the incentive to advance oneself."

t3_1c11cx,c9cjvuj,"Ultimately, though (and I recognise that I've written a lot tonight) my objection to your plan lies in the fact that you're taking a positive freedom (the health benefit and disability benefit), and holding it hostage in exchange for the weight loss program."

t3_1am1gg,c8yrmeo,however when ur looking at state funded education; these skills like engineering are very fact checked; a communist bridge builder and and anarchist bridge builder; kinda would both agree on the basic ideas of gravity and the shape of a bridge when u have a history major u dont know if they thought fdr helped or harmed the great depression

t3_33xvlb,cqpfr89,"The problem arises, though, that if you treat ""best"" strictly as a subjective term in that way, it is by definition impossible to create a best game, and therefore a best game will never be created, either in the past, present, or future."
t3_33x4zd,cqph109,"Cancer is thought to be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors, so even rare forms of cancer have to do with you participating in modern society with its associated carcinogens in the air we breathe, the foods we eat and the liquids we drink."

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"But we never learned in my classes, for example, that the US turned away many, many Jews trying to escape the Holocaust, even though the immigration quota was nowhere near filled for most of the war."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"So even though the Holocaust is pretty ingrained, there's still a lot of pieces missing from the full puzzle of shared blame."

t3_30dwuy,cpris3v,They thought it was bad timing and a bad move for Republicans politically.
t3_30bmbr,cpqwt64,"Either teaching them philosophy would focus on one philosopher or general philosophy and basically be indoctrination, or it would teach a bunch of different philosophies, which, again, kids wouldn't really be developed enough to differentiate between on a meaningful enough level to really have it shape their thought process, and therefore just be a weird social studies/history course, with a bit of science thrown in assuming you touched on the scientific method."

t3_2unkg9,coa3lkt,"This has already been said, but I need to reiterate, these ideas are one point on a very slippery slope to censorship, the loss of free speech, and thought crime."
t3_2unkg9,coa3lkt,"The idea that someone should not be heard because an intellectual community considers them to be wrong would have prevented the enlightenment, spurned the free thought in Athens which led to great thinkers such as plato and Aristotle, and would have made the cultural changes of the last 100 years go much slower."
