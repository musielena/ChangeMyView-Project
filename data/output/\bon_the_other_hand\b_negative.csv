t3_2izjkk,cl74g9q,"It's an uncertain answer, which is why it seems rather strange to be so convinced that intelligent life only exists on earth. But on the other hand, assuming they've visited already and everything else you talked is a huge jump, I agree. Even something as secretive as the NSA has had whistle blowers."
t3_2c0frm,cjazvlb,"Most of the posts are about the absurdity and hypocrisy of most organized religion; which those of us who are religious can certainly appreciate! /r/antitheism on the other hand is about the eradication of religion altogether. I still find this subreddit interesting, but I can't relate to it in the same way I can to most posts in /r/atheism."
t3_2bbyzd,cj3tx1c,"There's never a good reason for him to be there. C3PO on the other hand, cares about the plot in his own way. he's scared of all of the stuff going on (which unlike Jar Jar, gives the impression that he understands it)."
t3_2a71ap,cis9yiw,"Pies are generally always the same shape and at the end of the day, they're just cooked fruit inside a crust. Cakes, on the other hand, can have a variety of flavors and textures. With pie all you get is fruit goop."
t3_2a71ap,cis9yiw,"With a pie, the best you can do is a pie graph. Cakes, on the other hand, URL There are limitless possibilities! Ninja edit for wording."
t3_26avz4,chpdbyq,"Chicken pie pie is just a way to eat chicken stew. Cake on the other hand is a sub type of bread, specifically a softer and sweeter bread. With a cake, as opposed to pie, you know it will have certain properties."
t3_25pnxw,chjpfx2,"It's a natural means of defense to protect against the sting. For me on the other hand, I have an irrational fear of roaches. Like petrified, need to leave the room, please someone help immediately type of fear."
t3_1ntqck,cclypjh,"Even if they don't get over it entirely, they still have a pretty good chance of being happy, even if it's only for a few moments a day. Being murdered on the other hand is permanent. You have no shot at ever being happy or having a good life or recovering."
t3_1ms5h6,ccca28r,"I think the value in modern medicine, when it is used properly, is primarily in pain management. Ultrasounds, on the other hand, speak very clearly and plainly. So do blood tests."
t3_1kmwmn,cbqlofq,"So again, this is not conservative. Increased permissiveness for the dominant religion on the other hand is true. However, there are a lot of ways that liberals are against this that have no practical goals other than to spite people."
t3_1kj8ll,cbpotjh,"I've been single now for over a year, and the women I hang out with either aren't attracted to me, or I'm not attracted to them. The men, on the other hand, have a tendency to regularly play with my hair, try to give me massages, sit on my lap, grind themselves on my crotch/grind their crotch on me, and just generally come onto me with alarming regularity. It's gotten to the point that most people think I'm attracted to men when they meet me because there's usually a guy doing something inappropriate to/at/on me."
t3_1jb0wl,cbcy8p6,"Pro-lifers will say the fetus has the same amount of rights as any other person, thus abortion is akin to murder. Pro-choicers, on the other hand, feel that a woman's right to their bodies supersedes that of the fetus (be it because they view the fetus as parasitic, or they argue that the fetus doesn't fill the requirements of a person yet , or any other argument along those lines.) The bottom line is that abortion, because it deals with two entities, is intrinsically linked and relevant to the rights of the two entities involved."
t3_1gxf5p,caovpfj,"Literature tends to get reread more often for that reason. Stories, on the other hand, are experiences about figuring out what is going to happen next. How will Ender deal with the other armies, when will Harry defeat Voldemort."
t3_1fsg25,cadh9xp,"And that's pointless and stupid and sucks. But on the other hand, you still have the entire world of heterosexuals to choose from. There are gay women out there who won't date bi women, but there's not nearly as many of them as there are straight/bi men who will."
t3_1d4q74,c9netj5,"Not to mention that ""in god we trust"" seems rather defeatist and to me seems like putting faith in something out of your control, and not taking responsibility. ""E pluribus unum"" on the other hand seems much more reflective of America. "
t3_1cc8uk,c9fff06,"I don't think the current system we have is appropriate for decreasing drug abuse, but my argument is in reference to the idea that drug abuse only harms the user. Legalizing prostitution, on the other hand, has been shown to URL such as child prostitution and sex trafficking. It's also shown to be URL in areas where prostitution is legal."

t3_1am01f,c90q7d9,"The massive interstate highway system has not been proven to have been a good economic choice because no one has a choice of whether or not they want to pay for the government-funded road system. Private roads, on the other hand, are paid for according to use, so it would only be profitable and financially stable in the long run if other people value the road's location and quality relative to the price of the road. Transportation networks in general would be much more efficient in the private sector."
t3_33f4nn,cqktzi5,"These societal feelings of disgust at homosexuality and polyarmory have developed over time because of the harm they produce in society. (likewise with incest) Polyamory on the other hand is frowned upon because it creates an unstable family unit and produces children that tend to have limited access to one of their parents. Again, its based on selfishness on the part of one or both parents."
t3_31j4y8,cq2seqm,"Serious question: What is so bad about not supporting minorities? Surely it doesn't sound like a ""fair"" policy, but on the other hand: does that matter? Tax breaks for the wealthy, supporting the Wall Street."
t3_2uid44,co8s8kd,It doesn't really have any bargaining power with nations because it's largely a consumer product company. [Aramco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco) on the other hand has some serious clout. These guys are really turning the screw on Russia's economy and Putin is really feeling it.
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8yko,"Things that stay in stasis are at best quaint or at worst, stale and deteriorating. But on the other hand, once you know you are losing something and people start fighting to keep it, it can re-emerge and bring in new followers and adherents. So in some ways, the threat of genuinely losing something may be what saves it, and if had just been eroded slowly over time by the grinding wheels of time, it wouldn't be saved at all."
