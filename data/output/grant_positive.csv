t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief. In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them. It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over."
t3_2q0mlm,cn2gr61,"First, knowledge of the hist has deeply influenced how I play and view argonians. Rather than playing an argonian from cyrodiil, who was raised in that culture, I find myself playing an immigrant from the black marsh. Note how interesting Madesi, in Riften becomes when we consider how unique his experience must be."
t3_2pjmrj,cmxddb6,"Certain forms of speech that undermine these values (e.g. threats, some instances of hate speech, especially if said by a public figure) are granted diminished protections. You may disagree with this, but the important part is that the vast majority of speech is offered much higher degree of protection, in practice."
t3_2pata1,cmv1bja,"Have you seen URL from the Khan Academy? Someone who's smarter at birth and meets with more early success can fall behind later, if they just take it for granted that they have things they're just naturally good at. If they don't have to work hard to succeed at those relatively easy things in primary and secondary school, by the time they get to tertiary education and life in general, they can fall hard when they encounter unexpected difficulty or mistakes."
t3_2osnqc,cmqhv5l,"Right now, one of the main criticisms of white people not wanting to talk about racism because they ""don't see race"", or they're ""color-blind"" is that white people get to enjoy being seen as the default . So if no one's talking about race, it's their culture that's being taken for granted as normal. It's their culture that gets to be upheld and appreciated if no one's mentioning anything about race."
t3_2osnqc,cmqhv5l,"So in the hypothetical utopia where it's become okay to stop talking about race now, that default status would also have to vanish. If we want other races to no longer need any special promotion or defense, our culture would instead have to take for granted that there's all types of traditions and backgrounds people could come from, which would all be seen as normal and valid without people batting an eyelash at how novel or exotic they are. Someone rocking up to work in an outfit we'd call ""ethnic"" would need to be seen as equally professional as a suit."
t3_2mm2dl,cm5ikfo,You can't let a mixed neighborhood's crime rate go up just because there are some people who aren't paying taxes. And how would a fire department distinguish between a building that catches fire filled with illegal immigrants from one filled with taxpayers? You want to talk about instituting a service to catch illegals and reduce their impact on the taxpayers?
t3_2mm2dl,cm5j6hr,"That's a great way to start a public health crisis. Imagine that an illegal immigrant comes in, and he comes down with a deadly disease. Now, playing the averages, a person with limited English and few job skills is more than likely in a day-labor construction job or a service industry job."
t3_2kypt8,clpwjwi,"If from the seller's side, it's irrelevant how much time you spend home, or how much data you access, then they won't charge an extra. No, because the global Internet infrastructure is increasingly taking this monthly fee system for granted. Cloud storage, video streaming, and online gaming are becoming the norm, developed and marketed with the expectation that anyone with a net access can freely use them."
t3_2jug85,clf92x6,"Give what you feel you can afford, which from how you describe your circumstances is more than zero. The other compromise to consider is something like Kiva, where you grant micro loans with a 99% payback rate. The -1% interest is only slightly less than you get in a savings account!"
t3_2j28la,cl81bji,"It does not give the government any responsibility for health care. And it does specifically deny the government the right to work on things that it doesn't specifically grant it the right to. So therefore by definition, military is ""ok"" and healthcare is ""not ok""."
t3_2isiv7,cl525xl,"Everyone in a country would be there on a recognized legal status and be able to participate in the democratic process to various degrees (either getting to vote, or be a candidate in, elections) if they are in the country permanently. However if we do have immigrants who for some reason want to permanently reside in the country but are incapable of passing a test on civics I do not think it is appropriate to give them the vote. This however would be a very rare case as people allowed to immigrate should be more than intelligent enough to pass the citizenship test."
t3_2giql7,ckm2t5e,"This will make anyone get turn off. Don't say you love yourself until you have granted a delta to someone on this page. Keep another thing in mind, getting your body to become better is not 'hating yourself', rather another aspect of 'loving yourself'."
t3_2gdd35,cki4q8y,"They often do. But once you grant ""Well ok, pre-marital sex is actually fine"", you undermine the authority that religious texts hold. That's why it normally takes enormous shifts in public opinion for religious leaders to begin adapting."
t3_2fu5da,ckcxhdv,"Everyone starts at the same line, and their successes or failures depend on their own effort. That's why if gay rights were granted to anyone who decided on a whim that they could reap the benefits without actually being gay, it would break that rule and make an unfair situation. The same problem happens with white people who claim to have Native American blood in them in order to get benefits from affirmative action and government programs."
t3_2fu5da,ckdjfgl,"Of course, whether someone chooses to be gay or is born gay shouldn't matter in how we treat them in day-to-day life. Courts require a higher bar to grant legal privileges and arguing that this characteristic is immutable is the best way to secure those rights. "
t3_2f48co,ck5tk52,"I'm glad you recognize the footing your claim is on. Even if I grant any of the above, how can we say that the government is involved? How can we say that this is an intentional effort to make people stupid, and not just a recognition that this stuff sells very well?"
t3_2f1tka,ck53hry,"I'd be more willing to believe you if we were talking about serial killers, but I think the offender in this case may be a little more relatable...unless you're talking about the worst, most brutal rape involving significant bodily harm beyond penetration. So I guess it depends on how you'd define ""rape"" -- if you include every time a woman submits to sex against her desire because of an imbalanced power dynamic in our male-centric culture, yeah, you can definitely teach that out of the culture, though granted it would be a long uphill battle. "
t3_2e98b1,cjxanmm,"We wouldn't be where we are without it. Personally, I just think you shouldn't take your memory for granted. I used to have the same view as you (and largely do, still), but I realized that no, you don't always remember everything you want to."
t3_2e98b1,cjxanmm,"Do you know that for sure? When something that you take for granted is suddenly gone, your perspective can change a lot. "
t3_2dlel3,cjqns9h,"I'm still not sure why you think Americans wouldn't be willing to stand up and defend their rights if things were to get more restrictive in the future. It seems pretty hypocritical to criticize Americans for ""taking freedom for granted"" when you do the same, no? Anyways, like I said, there hasn't really been anything that the government has done recently which has seriously warranted a nationwide, full-scale protest because nothing has decreased the quality of life for Americans."
t3_2dg4c1,cjpx7h2,"Alongside this I was also there for her milestones. Not the ones, normal babies have, the little ones that we all take for granted, her first 5mls, 10mls, 20mls of milk. her first stool, the first time she swallows milk, her first cry for food when we know we can feed her, her first day of not being assisted by intravenous nutrition, the first day we can hold her with no tubes."
t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"Because (as far as I know, at least) virtually no one who studies normative ethics would agree to this version of utilitarianism that commits us to kidnapping people and putting them in the experience machine, I believe that it's almost certainly false, at least until I have good reason to think it's true. Okay, that's not something that most of the experts in the field of ethics believe, but grant that it's true. In that case, your view that you want changed amounts to nothing more than ""According to one bizarre theory of ethics that no one takes seriously, kidnapping someone and forcibly connecting them to the experience machine is morally justified."""
t3_2bbyzd,cj3zuoq,"Instead of being a stupid joke? The next most important thing Jar Jar does is make a speech imploring the Senate to grant emergency powers to the Emperor. That's right, instead of making a powerful ""the best of intentions, wait, oh god, what the hell have I done?"
t3_2av5cs,ciz37g5,"But really, there are a lot of people who are suffering in many ways that we can't even really comprehend. I think that there's value there, and I think the people who embody that - the homeless, the vagrants and the lost - are helpful at recalling to us that we are all broken, and that there's a great need for grace in our interactions, not only with them, but with all people who's choices we don't agree with, and ultimately with each person we meet. "
t3_2a299i,ciqsytr,"Leaving friends and family behind is tough, and forging new friendships and relationships can be challenging, especially if there's a language barrier. Culture shock is real, and you'll learn to appreciate some things about American culture that you had taken for granted before. Overall this can be a positive experience."
t3_287z9c,ci8aubw,"Before the concept of religion was even born, creation myths and deity figures were simply part of culture, like Batman and Spiderman are to us. You took the myths for granted, but they also became a way of distinguishing your people from other people, like a shibboleth. Religion didn't become separate from culture until a few thousand years ago (probably as a result of the Romans)."
t3_26rdo4,chtuhl8,"They were also the mouth-piece for the significant social changes of the time (mostly hippies). Their impact my not be so obvious today, but many of the standards that you take for granted today are because of them. "
t3_24faei,ch6lkf5,"The court still assumes the fit parent knows what s/he is doing and it is in the child's best interest. Usually these statutes and case law just say (a) grandparents have standing to petition for visitation rights, and; (b) consideration of granting them can only occur once they have met some burden that the visitation is so imperative to the child's best interests that the parent's decision is wrong. If you'll notice, the article backs what I said, because this was the very basis for overturning the lower court's decision:"
t3_24bof3,ch5k7ny,"It may seem as if its a wasted vote, but should those votes add up enough they do open up doors and possibilities beyond the two party system we have now. Are you aware that should 5% of the population vote 3rd party, that candidate qualifies for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund's grant? This access can greatly expand a candidate's ability to be heard."
t3_22p8vc,cgph660,"So even if biology conditions behavior to some extent we can still recognize the way ideas are created and question our assumptions and change the way we behave toward those ideas. You're pretty much granting that at least that much free will is possible by posting in change my view so I'm taking it as a given. There's not really any one ""Social construct theory"" so let's talk about something more specific, like URL )."
t3_22lgvs,cgnzhfe,"If black students beat up Korean students at a school, are black people oppressors? What about a Korean immigrant shooting a young black woman because of racial stereotypes? If we can all be oppressors and oppressed, then this class hatred stuff falls apart real quick."
t3_22itbs,cgn992q,"(As an aside: Why should they if they already live in a stateless society? We only take it for granted that people would want something approximating social organization like we have now; if we lived in a culture of worker self-management, individual autonomy, and collective decision making, it would be difficult to imagine why people would want to give up their way of life for a system that leads to foreclosures, evictions, job loss, etc.) EDIT: Formatting, some grammar."
t3_21hpd2,cgd84zz,"We know other animals feel pain, how does not having self-awareness lessen that pain? Self-awareness is probably an argument against granting unconditional right to life to these animals; they probably don't know what they're missing, but they can most definitely feel and understand pain. My point on abortion/infanticide wasn't particularly well explained, and it is ultimately an issue you will have to find your own view on."
t3_20ndjd,cg54ghs,"At this point, we've reduced your claim to something like this: ""Being religious might occasionally make some people more moral."" I'll grant you that. People who behave morally do so for all sorts of reasons, and some of those reasons are probably religious in nature."
t3_20mxh2,cg5cj8f,"TL;DR: A truly fair system provides reasonable case-by-case flexibility that considers ability to pay, circumstances of offense, and harm done to society. The current system (at least in Ontario, Canada) calls for a fine not to exceed some predetermined value, and grants both prosecutors and judges discretion to reduce that amount based on the individual circumstances of the offender, both with respect to the nature of the offence, and the offender's ability to pay. Thus, if a CEO in his BMW is caught driving 28 km/h over the limit, he is likely to pay the maximum fine of $295."
t3_20madh,cg4ndzh,"Why though, does the success of one impact the other? Building ten LHC's instead of the ISS would not have discovered 10 particles, and nor would building another ISS instead of the LHC (and other similar projects) grant us much more. "
t3_206k70,cg0b3so,"After all there are very few fields that completely exclude STEM or humanities. Mathematicians give speeches, lawyers analyze forensic evidence, researchers write grants, teachers create grading policies, etc. A clear example is the entrepreneur: they must be logical in order to market, sell, and make a profit, but they must also be effective at communication, persuasion, and harnessing creative energy."
t3_1zwn1x,cfxnbo6,"Imagine it's not your ass for a moment. imagine a large, hairy, pimple speckled backside, right in your face with the fragrant remains of recent expulsions regally daubed about the bunghole itself (and perhaps a few spots farther afield than waste ought to have traveled. You are tasked with cleaning this magnificent edifice."
t3_1zrq6d,cfwfj26,"What matters, ultimately, is maintaining an individual journal's quality standards and ensuring that high levels of scholarship are maintained. Ultimately, when the scientific work is done by scientists in the public employ, funded by publicly funded grants (which are reviewed by publicly funded peers and managed by publicly funded program managers), published in journals whose editors are working pro bono as part of their publicly funded job, refereed by scientific peers paid by the public, and then publication fees paid by these same grants (even most traditional journals have page changes), then it makes sense for these articles to be as widely accessible as possible to the same public, not shuttered behind a corporate paywall. This just strikes me as unethical and a disservice to the public we're purportedly serving."
t3_1zrq6d,cfwi0om,"If we wish to marshal the entire world's scientists in solving our hardest problems (of which we have plenty), then I truly believe we need to abolish this tiered access system, one that exploits public investment for (often) private gain, and level the playing field. Unfortunately, the researchers are getting hit anyway under the traditional model as they either have to get their institutions to shell out several thousands of dollars a year for each site's journal subscription, or else buy several private subscriptions out of one's grant money. I regularly read articles from over twenty different journals."
t3_1y3vw7,cfh6xl3,"You will most likely earn signifcantly more if you remain in college. Further, you have a grant. The only cost for you therefore is the money you're giving up that you would have earned during your time at college."
t3_1wxy0c,cf6e7lp,Since we have no experience with non-existence there's no way for us to meaningfully weigh it's significance. Otherwise you can't say that granting life is valuable in and of itself. 
t3_1we3gg,cf15san,"I am interested to see what others have to say as well. And I couldn't agree more about not taking life lightly, and appreciating my body and not taking it for granted. I can't believe, sometimes, the things I see people willingly do to their healthy bodies."
t3_1tqlde,ceahpf0,"Could you think of Santa as an age-appropriate answer for the social expectation that your child believes in Santa? Perhaps in your family, there's no North Pole, there's no Reindeer, but Santa is just a hard working dude who grants wishes. Or perhaps in your family, Santa is in idea, he's just the spirit of Christmas, and your child can send him a letter and he gets some shit done, but at the end of the day it's really you who bring the present."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"He argues that without a well-loved person at the helm, India would have fallen apart. Sitting here in 2013, we take for granted that India as a country always existed, and would have gotten her freedom eventually, but I disagree. India did not exist except on British maps ."
t3_1s3pxw,cdtmhc2,"""A fish doesn't understand the concept of water"" might be analogous. 300 years ago it was taken for granted that witches cause disease, so when a couple of villagers came down with the same symptoms everyone took it for granted that they have to find the witch and burn her to solve the problem. From their point of view, it was as logical as someone today concluding that they have a dead battery if their car won't turn over."
t3_1s3pxw,cdtmhc2,"Ah crap, time to find someone who can give me a jump. When people accept religious concepts as deep and immutable facts it's just like growing up and taking oxygen for granted. Of course God exists, he made the Earth and everything on it, and he said he wasn't going to fuck around with the climate after the Great Flood."
t3_1s3pxw,cdv43gy,"Not every religious person takes the existence of a god to be self-evident &amp; unquestionable. Also, lets say we grant that you truly never met someone who came to their beliefs with logic. Does that necessarily mean that therefore all religious persons are therefore incapable of rational thought?"
t3_1qj032,cdda585,"However for China to succeed in the future it needs to modernize and focus on growing the domestic market by empowering its consumers. You talked about granting more property rights to farmers/rural folk which is good, the government also decided to deregulate some investment vehicles (because quite frankly all those ghost towns are embarrassing), strengthen social security and create a more independent judiciary (as an aside: does that sound very technocratic to you?). What they didn't touch on however were the biggest problems, quoting from an article here made this morning:"
t3_1pbxrs,cd11w02,"Aka, 5% will suffer with the vaccine but 10% will suffer if it is not provided so it should be provided. It sucks for that 5%, they are worse off, but it's worse for those who don't get the protection that the vaccine would have granted. Now, the HPV vaccine."
t3_1orrrs,ccvj1c4,"In 2010, the US birth rate URL . In fact, the US population would be in decline if it were not for the fact that we get millions of (legal) immigrants each year. So as long as the children of these welfare parents eventually become tax-paying citizens (which all of them will, income tax aside), then technically ""society"" wants them all."
t3_1orrrs,ccvj1c4,"Any given welfare recipient might receive more money than they pay out in taxes (but who actually knows? ), but A) the money circulates/stimulates the economy regardless, B) the mere existence of a safety net allows everyone to make riskier investments/grants more class mobility. If you sign up for insurance on Monday and crash your car on Tuesday, is that unfair?"
t3_1nkqn7,ccjhnln,"I think Europe has a much more insular ""us vs them"" attitude about immigration in general. Everywhere has its problems, but in the US the ""culture of immigrants"" is much stronger and it's easier to ""just blend"". 3."
t3_1m4ncj,cc6f4wf,"It's not the Muslims' fault your nation became a bunch of pansies. If some immigrants don't want pork on the menu, tell them you don't give a damn. You're descendents of Vikings for crying out loud."
t3_1lpsaf,cc25ciq,"etc. So, given that the vast majority of what we mistakenly take for granted as ""intelligence"" is actually persistence and diligence (and interest), is there a genetic factor to intelligence? Without a doubt yes, but once again, based on what I've seen in academia, which is where the performance of ""intelligence"" is most closely regulated and measured with testing and assignments, virtually all of the success I saw came from undeniable and mindblowing amounts of hard work."
t3_1l3d69,cbvenj2,"there is absolutely no reason why changing your life from being a doormat to not, means you wont ever find meaningful relationships. look the fact is not all women are mature enough to realize the value of nice guys, so they take them for granted or abuse them. so a way to weed those kinds of women out of your life is to simply not allow them to take advantage of you."
t3_1l39f3,cbvj6st,"and the person just stared at her utterly confused like that thought had never occurred to her before. People like you and me take it for granted that you are supposed to ""do what you love and the money will follow"" or ""you can be anything when you grow up."" But not everyone's parents and community tells them that."
t3_1kbeez,cbn9wrg,"Given that women in pornos frequently fake orgasms for the camera, this leads men to expect that if they aren't consistently causing their partners to orgasm, they are sub-par. Pornos, if anything, take the satisfaction of women a little TOO for granted, and this can seriously impact the way men view their partner's reactions. The man in some ways exists to please the woman, even if the woman is objectified in the sense that it's the woman's pleasure that is important to pleasing the man."
t3_1i3z9w,cb0swyr,"ie. You make a hypothesis, spend tons of effort fighting for grant money, then spend hundreds or thousands of hours in the lab testing it before you have a result. This process is specific to the natural sciences, and is not how research in mathematics works necessarily."
t3_1i3z9w,cb0swyr,"This process is specific to the natural sciences, and is not how research in mathematics works necessarily. In mathematics there is not the same need to fight for grant money because the research is much cheaper. Also, in pure math there is not really any time in a lab testing a hypothesis, rather the emphasis is spent on trying to prove a theorem."
t3_1i2u57,cb0fo0o,"Now, if you want to look up treatments for these kinds of disorders, you'll notice that ""tough love"" doesn't work as a treatment, and in fact, makes them worse. Now, granted, I have come across a few teenage dumbasses who thought suicide is ""cool"", but I doubt that those are the people who are the main suicidal demographic. Look at the countries with the highest suicide rates (Japan and South Korea)."
t3_1hmzrg,cavwamg,"Assuming we only use wealth as an indicator..... Aboriginals almost universally fall into the lower economic ring. Black people have a significant issue with that as well and definitely recent immigrants. Congratulations, you've just committed peaceful genocide."
t3_1hf3eh,catuwc7,"The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares.

t3_1h9sqe,cas8w59,"In-terminal editors can be easily used over ssh with minimal lag, etc. Big advantage to a lot of people (granted, this also applies to things like emacs and nano). Does Vim have a sharp learning curve?"
t3_1h13j4,capskux,"This is not a matter of abortion as much as it is a right to remove what is not your body from your body. Aborting a fetus which is not viable is choosing to remove life support, a choice granted to the host of life support due to the fetus not being an independent and competent adult. Doing this via abortion could be compared to an overdose of morphine rather than pulling the plug and letting the entire existence of the fetus off life support be a much slower and certain death."
t3_1gjdzq,caks2pc,"Ah, yes and no. The ability to do violence and the monopoly on violence, the ability to kill civilians, to create law and grant exception from it, can all be seen as violence and all contribute to the ""rule of law.""

t3_1fdqr9,ca9b99t,"If you can justify that, what happens when the tide turns? I don't know your background, but in some countries like France the immigrant Muslim population is increasing rapidly and France might quickly become a Muslim country.

t3_1f4wxs,ca70g5u,"You believe that developing a vaccine requires them to have profitable investments before being able to finance the vaccine. Companies could still finance the vaccine from government grants, money from foundations, risk/equity capital, loans, profits from other drugs and profits from other parts of the company. Losing part of their profits won't prevent them from financing future vaccines, and as long as its profitable to make the vaccine it makes financial sense to invest in one."
t3_1f14ip,ca69sod,"My professors agree with this, and when I've taken alternate kinds of testing (like an oral exam in a professor's office where I do the test on a chalkboard in front of the professor) I have yet to get less than an A, whereas my on-paper tests usually range around a B- or C. Even when I don't use the extra time, it's a bit of padding that keeps my anxiety down, which allows me to do better. Average test grade before I was granted extra time - low C to high D.

t3_1dx9dj,c9uvfc4,"3. The act of voting, the feeling that you're participating, grants (some, not all) people a greater sense of responsibility in the outcome. It's kind of like gambling."
t3_1di0zr,c9qn5bx,"Many atheists argue that morality can be logically derived, but I'd chop off my left hand right now if none of those atheists evade taxes, are sometimes cruel to animals or intentionally inflict (mental) harm on others. Ethics are more fragile than people think, we take them for granted because they've been taught to us from the moment we could learn them and because everyone around us follows them. The truth is that ethics and morality are probably the greatest achievement of mankind, it's our first triumph over our nature and it allowed us to form civilizations."
t3_1dfy2a,c9pz92y,"Women fought and largely won the right to bodily autonomy. Gaining that right implicitly granted women unilateral control over the decision to have a child. This is how it should be for the most part, but we should also now consider that there is a new imbalance, that men have no ability to prevent becoming a father short of abstinence, which is what women were fighting for previously."
t3_1cocdc,c9j13yk,"One reason we might not want people doing that for routine surgery, though, is that it directly impacts a hospital's competence at the harder stuff. If you read the Daily Mail you will be aware the NHS is closing a lot of child heart surgery units because of... immigrants or something (it's the Mail , what are you going to do?) The actual reason is that infant cardiology is so complicated that if your team isn't doing about 400 operations a year you are a liability to patients."
t3_1cbyg8,c9f2fbr,"If that's the claim you want to make, then that's fine, but I could also argue that, if you like. I will grant you that there are a lot of religious people that make the rest of us religious people look bad. It may sound weird, but I'm a Christian who is a big proponent of science."
t3_35007e,cqzpsh4,"Prosecuting leaders who cross the line is part of how we send the message that ""these things are not ok from our leaders."" Finally, consider what behavior you incentivize by granting full immunity for departing leaders: They have literally no reason not to be as vicious as possible while in office, including doing terrible things to stay in office, because they will receive a full pardon. It's why it's so important that international courts start prosecuting dictators and warlords."
t3_35007e,cqzpsh4,"He was ousted by violent revolution, which generally is unnecessary in true democracies. In Egypt's case it might be worth granting pardons in the name of peace, but that was not a case of a democratic handover of power. "

Immigrants do learn the local language I don't know why this one gets bandied around so much. If you don't learn English, your career opportunities are reduced to menial labour for an employer of the same nationality and being a housewife."
t3_32xbei,cqfidzs,"I'm not sure how much clout you give historical treatment, but America has been less than kind to Asia as a whole. In the 1800's Chinese immigrants were considered to be basically disposable people during construction if the transcontinental railroad. We rounded up Japanese Americans into internment camps during world war two."
t3_31j4y8,cq2dy2t,"Republicans have been on the opposite end of every feminist issue for decades, LGBT rights and homosexual marriage is just the latest in a long line of it, but more women are graduating college and finding good jobs than ever before, and women, especially educated ones, skew heavily Democratic. The core Republican demographic (white, male, christian, wealthy, rural) is shrinking while their opposition demographics (hispanics, african americans, immigrants, women, urban) are all increasing. While I actually think the Republican party has a lot of good ideas on the fiscal planning side, and often favor their economic policies over Democratic ones, it's hard for anyone younger and more progressive to support the party, due to the nature of its religious affiliations and extremely outdated social policies."
t3_30ijtn,cpsuz6r,"There are tons of other things too, but i think just the aforementioned is enough to deter implementation of automation in fast food, at least for the time being...one day we will have a bunch of I Robots running around, but today is not that day nor is tomorrow When the technology arrives, it will be...but AI hasnt gotten there yet... Im a mechanical engineer who works in a factory with robots, granted its not Watson state-of-the-art tech, but they fuck up a lot more often than most people would think. Its just not as simple as ""automate ALL of the ""street-sweeper"" jobs!!"
t3_2zxz9r,cpnemdd,"In this model, the ignorant and apathetic serve as a buffer to prevent friction between the two sides. As for my final paragraph, I was stating that granting respect, dignity, autonomy, and control to individuals and groups is a benefit which outweighs the slightly suboptimal choices which may result.

t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"One of the strengths of America, historically, is that we've had one national language that everyone can communicate in. We've always had large immigrant communities, but never had a problem with large segments of the population being excluded from American society, or rivalry between different linguistic blocs, or the public sphere fragmenting into two different discussions. Getting everyone to speak English is just good coordination."
t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"In still other cases it relates to tyranny. Whatever the cause is, an immigrant who is moving from Country A to Country B needs to seriously consider the possibility that part of the reason that Country B isn't shitty is that B-ish culture builds successful societies. And if you are, essentially, leaving a team where the team's customs and attitudes made life miserable for lots of people on the team, and joining a new team where the customs and attitudes have made life great, it would be pretty hypocritical not to try to pick up the customs and attitudes of your new team."
t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"Now, you can reply to this in lots of ways. You can say that maybe some immigrants were forced to come here by their parents, so they aren't committed to either -1- or -2-. Maybe the immigrants believe their country is actually more successful, but they just like the scenery here."

t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"Or maybe they know their native country is shitty, and admit the culture plays a role, but don't see why they shouldn't simply reap the benefits of their hosts' culture while despising it. You can make any of these five excuses, or maybe a lot more, but you can't say it's unreasonable for the hosts to think they should integrate, because it's not unreasonable to assume that immigrants have some serious reason for preferring the host country, that overall a large net influx of immigrants suggests the host country is systematically more successful in a way that the immigrants themselves appreciate, and that cultural differences do explain some differences between some countries. And if those are reasonable things to think, then even though you don't have to agree with them, you certainly have to admit that there's nothing wrong with expecting immigrants to integrate, and that that expectation can be motivated by something other than racism."

t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"The third is that you think Muslims could become Swedes, but they don't want to. As an American, your views strike me as charmingly European, because if I restated these views about my own country: ""expecting Muslim immigrants to love America and its cultural history as much as Americans do is absurd"", well, it's grotesque. Most Muslim immigrants are already Americans."

t3_2x53ga,cowyiod,"The idea that culture can be ""spoiled"" or ""corrupted"" simply doesn't make sense. Immigrants come in, they get influenced and influence. In a generation or two, they simply part, like all others, of a different culture."
t3_2vhgab,cohtk17,"Why should I care about the symbolism or cinematography or soundtrack or whatever of a film if it's occurring against the backdrop of ""a bunch of shit is happening that I don't care about?"" And granted, this isn't true for every film. I can think of a large handful of movies where the plot isn't the first level you're supposed to enjoy: Across the Universe is about listening to new versions of Beatles songs; Avatar is about seeing groundbreaking 3D visual effects."
t3_2uj4yv,co9ncgk,"Mandating certain (extremely minimal) rules towards obtaining that education is most effective way I can imagine that also maintains the least invasiveness. This is also mostly accomplished via grants/funding, so it's not like they're outright using force, just monetary incentives. Finally, abortion....this will be interesting."

t3_2ug2wi,co834v1,"entropy), though you mention infinities at some point, which segues into my next point. I will grant you that there are prevailing theories about the infinite nature of the universe and how that can lead to exact duplicates of structures in the universe, and therefore exact copies of yourself. Considering the very nature of infinity, it's impossible for there not to somehow be an atom-for-atom duplicate of yourself, and eventually then for the exact same circumstances of your life to arise."
t3_2t6ote,cnw8hwh,"Presumably nothing. If no ""crime"" took place, why would the courts grant CPS custody? Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it must seem to make reports and nevertheless see these horrible excuses for parents take babies home to what will inevitably amount to shitty home situations."
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8scl,"Also, as long as poverty and inequality are real things, people from poorer regions will always seek economic opportunity in richer regions. Before, these migrants were not so visible because it cost a lot to move and, since the cost reduced the numbers of migrants, it was also a lot harder socially to be a stranger in a strange land. They way you phrase it, it seems you want to say the opposite."
