t3_2rnr30,cnhlmdo,I wont go into gun problems but rather define USA's basic laws and their impact on stopping situations like the one in Paris today.
t3_2rnr30,cnhlmdo,If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.
t3_2rnr30,cnhotka,If half the citizens carried in public places MP5's with 30 round clips you may be able stop a few random encounters over the years but then again you'd have citizens turning into militants.
t3_2rnfn0,cnhjtqq,"It's assumed that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't."
t3_2rnfn0,cnhjtqq,"The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way."

t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's Tractatus , but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"In actuality, my philosophical education (I minored in it but took as many classes in it as a major) involved tons of rigorous reading and papers, and included topics like AI theory, nature studies, and tort law."

t3_2rmwcd,cnhbzmc,"Free speech will always include speech which offends, but causing offense isn't a violation of the social contract."
t3_2rmwcd,cnhbzmc,"In that case, not only do the bullies still get to use violence to suppress the speech which offends them, but now they don't face the consequences of using violence in violation of the social contract."
t3_2rkzen,cnhbiku,"As you put it, the entire goal of eugenics is to make the human race more likely to advance and survive, but the irony of eugenics is that one of the best ways we can guarantee our survival is to maximize the size of our gene pool."
t3_2rkzen,cnhn00f,"You can limit the less intelligent, but you can't force the more intelligent to have them."
t3_2rkjr3,cnhhz9u,I do not think knowledgeable people are wasting their time by contributing their knowledge to a form that can be quickly scanned to understand the most upvoted (and hopefully best) arguments for and against a point.
t3_2rkjr3,cnhhz9u,"We are here because we don't have the time to read entire books for and against topics, but would at least like to familiarize ourselves with the top points."
t3_2rgs7o,cnfu7mt,It's a nice story but it's still fiction.
t3_2rexe3,cnfgbjs,"Rooster's Men's Grooming ($5 - $10 off a full package haircut) Army/Navy Surplus (10% off) McDonald's (Free drinks while on-shift in the drive-thru) There's others, but I can't think of them right now."
t3_2rekjo,cnf5hhy,"Option 4: you don't care for animals' suffering but you enjoy their taste, so you continue to support the meat industry."
t3_2rcsdh,cneta9f,"If large enough numbers of people are forced into unemployment or underemployment, eventually the social pressure will either force some kind of wealth redistribution and adjustment for a ""post-scarcity"" society or perhaps the wealthy will provide minimum resources to an enslaved population."
t3_2rcrkd,cnfccqz,"Cows don't care about messed up environment, but raped person will be damaged even more by STI."
t3_2rcrkd,cnfccqz,Kinda we rape cows but get STIs to ourselves.
t3_2rcrkd,cng1g5i,This is interesting but different discussion.
t3_2rcrkd,cng1g5i,Won't save us but lets to run longer.
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"4chan has certainly desensitized me through the years, but has shown me another side of the human psyche."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"If we wanted to put ourselves out there, we could but we weren't encouraged to do so as a societal norm."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"If we offended the wrong person, we'd get hacked but not our entire lives potentially ruined while people laughed about it!"
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"There's a lot of noise on 4chan, but you can navigate past it and find some excellent content."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"You can ignore someone, sure, but their comment will be right up top where yours is chronologically on any of the chans."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"4chan may have it posted multiple times within seconds/minutes as well, but the one with the most enticing headline and immediate comments will always appear on the front page (or at least in the catalog) and the successful thread is the one used to near capacity, then redirected to the next big thread all the while without karma whores pushing eachother for control...the would-be karma whores are simply wasting their time trying to use a thread that's not as popular about a same topic."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"If someone is an asshole and ""triggers"" someone into doing something, it's sad, but the ""triggered"" still makes their own choice."
t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"You're completely correct in the belief that medical people going to Africa to treat ebola are putting themselves at risk of catching ebola, but all-in-all the chance of catching ebola in a controlled environment is very low, so low in fact that the news continues to report on each case that occurs."
t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"Obviously the risk of catching ebola is higher, but it is such a low percentage chance that it could almost be ignored."
t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"Whether you believe this burden is unfair to the point where bad consequences are a form of comeuppance is up to you, but that would require you to believe that all risky behavior requires the implicit permission of all your social connections- which isn't a standard I would want to limit myself to."
t3_2r7f0g,cnd4xb4,"In Avatar, perhaps its a more cynical and arguably more realistic situation where the corporations come in with their might and try to reap the bounty from the world regardless of the native's desires... but does that justify them?"
t3_2r6fw9,cncxwgs,"For instance, eggs are generally fully edible weeks after the sell by date, but may be less optimal for baking."
t3_2r6a86,cncxj5i,"If items where nerfed excessively, I would see were you where coming from, but what would be the purpose of having them."
t3_2r6a86,cnd9u6t,"I don't mind items in a game with good and bad players, but it makes the game about luck in games with only great players."
t3_2r4u3k,cncnikt,"That is certainly one reason why they would create a dress code, but there are others as well."
t3_2r4b8f,cnchpr4,"It doesnt make the 30 year old automatically smarter/more intelligent/more wise than the 17 year old, but the odds of that being true are absolutely in the older person's favor."
t3_2r3fa4,cnc6h09,"I can go more in depth if you want, but I believe that your religion or lack thereof doesn't make a bit of difference in how you're judged at the end of your life."
t3_2r0eyf,cnb8f1r,"Sure, our decisions are the result of physical processes, but why does that make them less meaningful?"
t3_2r0eyf,cnb8f1r,"In short: We may not have ""free will"" but we certainly have ""will"", and that's all that really matters."
t3_2r07cv,cnbl2z0,"So it's not the transgender that the bible would think are immoral, but the people who tell them that they don't belong for their differences."
t3_2r07cv,cnbl2z0,"So it's not the transgender that the bible would think are immoral, but the people who tell them that they don't belong for their differences."
t3_2r07cv,cnbep9a,"You could say it's an ACT of homosexuality, but hey, if you're transgender, it's an act of daily life."
t3_2r07cv,cnbep9a,"PS - I know I've referred to homosexuality a lot in this post, but that's purely because transgender folks get shit on by Christians because they're perceived to be some sort of mutated homosexual and every argument against the existence of homosexuals in the bible is invalid."
t3_2r07cv,cnbkdhs,"I took ejaculation outside the vagina and other stuff like Jewish men not talking to Samaritan women or even prohibition of homosexual relations as a means to preserving semen for the continuation of their own people, not because of modern conservative fears but because of actual child survival rates in that time period."
t3_2qy21w,cnaxt0m,"Well, it's not 100% fair, but it's fairer than allowing him to force an unwanted abortion on a woman who loves her child to be and wants to keep it, or allowing him to disavow his financial responsibility by saying he doesn't want this particular child."
t3_2qy21w,cnb1crf,"Maybe this child will be healthy, but if she waits til later, that other baby will have a birth defect."
t3_2qy21w,cnb1crf,"We do have some control over our reproduction, but ultimately that control is very limited."
t3_2qslmz,cn96797,"So, Maybe I have to go in to the next game down a character or two, but you'll never experience the palm-sweating, gut wrenching intensity I get to experience when I play my games, because my choices matter."
t3_2qslmz,cn96797,"The ME series actually gives you the chance not just to watch one unfold, but to actively participate."
t3_2qslmz,cn96797,"People may find, say, Romeo and Juliet to be a great tragic story... but nothing compares with seeing a beloved character die and knowing it's your fault this happened."
t3_2qrlmm,cna3vcn,"Modern society needs laws as complex as they are, but its not in the average person's interest to have full knowledge of it."
t3_2qrlmm,cna3vcn,"Modern society needs laws as complex as they are, but its not in the average person's interest to have full knowledge of it."
t3_2qrbaf,cnajqzu,So I saw you gave a delta anyways but I'll throw my opinions out there.
t3_2qrbaf,cnajqzu,"I agree with you that the quality of the movie matters, but if both versions are good movies and didn't make unnecessary changes then I think they are different rather than one being better."
t3_2qr8gn,cn8tfsm,"I know anecdotal evidence isn't the best for an argument, but hear me out."
t3_2qqxoy,cn8o8sq,"Note that I am not saying that otherkin are not wrong , but rather that their beliefs are generally harmless to themselves and others and that, like in the case of homosexuals, attempts to ""treat"" them are likely to cause serious damage to their mental health and sense of self."
t3_2qqa7z,cn8hi2i,"Swimming is good for this, but running takes it to a whole different level."
t3_2qqa7z,cn8hi2i,"of course, runners use the lower body more than the upper body, but the same is true for swimmers in reverse (they use more upper than lower) It should be noted that this is an apples to oranges comparison."
t3_2qnzap,cn7wwbo,"(IRL we could sell them to other people, but the value still stays with the bosses) This means that there will always be more product than there is money."
t3_2qnzap,cn7wwbo,This happens on a much larger scale and gets immensely more complicated but is ultimately why companies go bankrupt.
t3_2qnzap,cn7wwbo,"We generally think of going bankrupt as a bad thing, but is it?"
t3_2qmstv,cn7q0wo,"I, and I'm sure plenty of other casual gamers, like this aspect of these games but I know that also contributes to criticism."
t3_2qmstv,cn7q0wo,I'd agree with that but I don't believe that the CoD series is considered particularly critically successful.
t3_2qmstv,cn7q0wo,"Not that I'm in tune with the ""gamer"" media but they've always seemed to be regarded as ""well, good for what they are"""
t3_2qmhw7,cn7hmr1,"But if your contributions are welcome and socially appropriate (e.g., you're not spamming the subreddit with new posts), then why does the ""attention seeking"" (if that's what it is) strike you as being a problem?"
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Networking can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but certainly no one is defending outright nepotism (let's just give the job to my cousin because reasons)."
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Also, not only are some applicants bad fits for certain jobs, but some jobs are bad fits for certain applicants."
t3_2qia6o,cn76xcf,"I'll certain concede that its bad and happens, but to me this isn't a criticism of ""networking"" in a broad sense."
t3_2qb4ra,cn4hsaa,"The real skill in Monopoly comes into play in the mid-game, when you have properties and money to trade but there isn't a clear winner yet."
t3_2qb4ra,cn4hsaa,"I've found that a lot of people don't take advantage of this, but you can pay rent with anything as long as the person who owns the property accepts it."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4ba9v,"I like your post and I think you have some good ideas, but some things to consider: I'll just say that a parent in a bad economic situation will probably A) have to spend more time working and less time with their child, B) live in a shitty neighborhood, and C) wouldn't be able to counter any negative social pressure as much."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4ba9v,"This doesn't reflect poorly on the parents or say that the child is dumb, but some children develop later than others."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4ba9v,"I foresee a problem with too much pressure being put on teachers, especially with evaluating kids that try really hard but are simply average students."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4ba9v,not quite related but there was a URL about paying high schoolers for passing grades.
t3_2qaf6l,cn4ba9v,"It pushed kids on the bubble a bit higher, but had no effect on consistently bad students."
t3_2q9fkx,cn4ebjb,"A more sensible calendar might be, like, a little better, but how much?"
t3_2q6x54,cn3f94v,"We all have attributes of various genders, which are the social norms of our culture."
t3_2q6x54,cn3f94v,That doesn't make a person multiple genders but perhaps puta them in a middle state.
t3_2q6k6o,cn3c0uh,"You love your dad, but your dad was bad at relationships."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3c0uh,"That's the lay of the land, but I'd like to mention a few things in your story: GET OUT."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3c0uh,"I'm advocating an extremely harsh metric here, and plenty of people would disagree with me, but I'm tailoring this to you, yes you, with the trust issues."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3c0uh,"You will be less sexist when you realize that the men are exactly the same, but because you aren't trying to fuck them it doesn't bother you so much."
t3_2q6816,cn38xe9,"I assume it is being blocked at my work, but I've never bothered to check."
t3_2q6816,cn38xe9,"Others have already made some good points about positions where you don't have a constant stream of work, but are being paid to be there so you can react quickly when it shows up."
t3_2q6816,cn3b495,"I haven't seen this reply yet, and I know I'm late here, but I work in IT, so my work is dependent upon problems occurring."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Um... Not sure what series you watched, but Asami is not a minor character."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Look, I don't want to play at the foreshadowing / when did they decide this game, because we're not the writers, but I honestly feel like you just haven't been paying attention during seasons 3 and 4."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"The extent to which there were romantic undertones can be debated, but some sort of unique relationship was clearly there."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"I do feel that as a character, she got crowded out a bit in the second half of season 4 by Varrick/Zhu Li in terms of plot contributions, but as far as her relationship with Korra, that's neither here nor there."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Mako didn't have much of a season 4 arc, which is why his pseudo ""self sacrifice"" felt awkward and forced to me, but I guess he can take some credit for turning Wu into less of a dope."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Asami didn't have a ton to do in Season 4 compared to earlier seasons, but when she was onscreen, her focuses were building trains and robots (check) and her relationships with her father (check) and Korra (checkmate, whether you noticed it or not)."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Maybe you think the last few minutes could have been better spent, but I just don't see all these dangling loose plot threads that you do."
t3_2q5zwb,cn3966e,"If there were more on this, I'd certainly watch it, but I thought I got more than enough closure in these areas."
t3_2q5zwb,cn3966e,"Maybe you think they did a better job telling that story, and that's fine, but it seems disingenuous to call having a relationship ""non-avatary""."
t3_2q4trg,cn2x9e7,"Which is fair grounds for some amount of consideration of a ""heat of the moment"" defense, to reduce (but not eliminate) punishment."
t3_2q4trg,cn2x9e7,"Second, gay and trans people suffer higher than average rates of victimhood, including murder - sometimes the statistics are exaggerated, but even serious estimates show that they do get assaulted and murdered more often."
t3_2q2cxc,cn2g775,"We don't currently understand how universes come to be, so this seems implausible today, but we have billions of years to figure it out."
t3_2q2cxc,cn2g775,"Might be true, but our current theories say otherwise."
t3_2pxqz4,cn12dq3,"Oh, ""Civil Unions"" are OK, but not ""Marriages,"" or maybe ""Domestic Partnerships"" or whatever."
t3_2pxql9,cn1a1iu,"BUT, you do not have a case in saying you can pirate because it infringes on the right of people to develop things on this planet and distribute them how they see fit."
t3_2pww37,cn0wcco,"Homophobia is somewhat acceptable for religious reasons, but racism and discrimination against religions isn't."
t3_2pw9tv,cn0ljyo,"He's no Hitler, of course, but only because North Korea isn't powerful enough to start annexing its neighbors and has no substantial minority population to send to death camps."
t3_2pw9tv,cn0ljyo,"Conspiracy to commit a crime is speech and it's still a problem, not because of the speaking but because of the crime."
t3_2pw9tv,cn0ljyo,Bullying is another kind of speech that hurts people; it's not the speech that's illegal but the hurting of others.
t3_2pw9tv,cn0ljyo,"But you're saying bullying of bullies is still bad -- well, sure, but Kim Jong Un isn't a bully."
t3_2pw9tv,cn0ljyo,"As a public figure, he's a valid target, but remember libel and slander are still illegal!"
t3_2pt2b2,cmzvst5,"I hate kids, but I don't HATE kids."
t3_2pt2b2,cmzvst5,"I never want children, and dislike most children I meet on a daily basis, for exactly the reasons you mentioned, but I still know several kids I do enjoy."
t3_2ps2mr,cmzyju1,"Mostly I want to point out a flaw in this particular line: ""Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public, but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy."""
t3_2ps2mr,cmzyju1,"This is basically the bulk of your argument, but it is entirely untrue."
t3_2ps2mr,cmzyju1,"For them, they only need to practice their technique, but its relatively easy for them to sing in public easily..."
t3_2ps2mr,cmzyju1,"Much in the same way, someone can learn 3 chords and sing a rough melody, but it doesn't make it a good song."
t3_2ppxgu,cmz3hz0,"This post feels more like a pre-emptive rebuttal of the negative aspects of SRS, rather than a positive expression of the good it does."
t3_2pp7pp,cmyxcrc,"There are a couple of common scenarios behind most comment and post removals, but they're almost always performed by mods within subs they created, or were invited to mod by the creators."

t3_2pod0t,cmyqnc7,"Nations tend to become more liberal as they develop (not in every case, but for the most part this trend sticks), meaning women have more opportunities to do things with their lives other than giving birth and raising kids, causing lower birth rates."

 TL,DR: * I'm not arguing that those beliefs don't exist, but they are far too complex to just write off as ""hypocritical:"
t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"This may seem logical, but it isn't right."
t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"Many people attribute their cultures, beliefs, morals, etc directly to their races."
t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"Not because I don't think I'm Caucasian, but because I identify with being Hispanic, and I want my government to acknowledge that."

t3_2irrk7,cl4u4v3,"For example, if we told a Native American to stop racially identifying themselves because it is contributing to seperation between them and the majority they would simply see it as another attempt by white people to erase their culture and history."
t3_2irrk7,cl4u4v3,"I actually agree with you in principle, but in practice your proposal would just lead to large groups of people feeling like their history, culture, and identity is being erased."
t3_2irrk7,cl4u4v3,"Maybe in a couple more decades, but as of right now, we're still way too close to the civil rights movement to even consider that kind of thing."

t3_2ir1vh,cl4qw6h,Many people claim not to be sexist but are.
t3_2ir1vh,cl4qw6h,"It's unfortunate, but that's why merely saying ""I'm an egalitarian"" or ""I'm not racist"" or ""I'm not sexist"" isn't actually terribly useful to anyone as a descriptor, as its what many (if not most) non-egalitarians, racists, and sexists will also say publicly."
t3_2ir1vh,cl4qw6h,"In addition, and maybe this is a better response, saying ""I'm an egalitarian"" is merely a description of your goals, but gives no indication of how to achieve them or the current state of the world."

t3_2130o9,cg99h0r,"Sure, some people will take the time to go and donate to a homeless shelter or other social services but that is a small fraction of the total amount of people who want to help, but feel they don't have the time."
t3_2108o3,cg8vacp,"Then, in addition to all of these traditional schools, you also have non-traditional for-profit schools, which are another issue entirely, but let's focus on the traditional settings - community colleges and four year universities, both public and private."

t3_2108o3,cg8em1w,"It can be the most frustrating exercise possible, but I found myself much happier when I began to view University as a place to learn to work with people."
t3_2108o3,cg8em1w,"So you're right insofar as it might not be the most ideal educational presentation, but if you can at all find any professors that are willing to take a personal interest, they can provide interactive guidance that isn't possibly available online."
t3_2108o3,cg8em1w,Sure the actual information is great.... but it's not nearly as important as the interpersonal skills that you'll gain if you really take to heart the holistic experience.

t3_1xg9o8,cfba5c5,"Israel is an exceptional circumstance, but I can tell you that in most countries of the Western world, there is simply no need for teachers to be armed, due to the fact that guns are not easy to get hold of, and therefore school shootings do not occur."

t3_1xg9o8,cfb8m1v,"Given your environment, I don't think it would be wrong to have a couple of select teachers trained and licensed to pack heat, or to have an officer or two assigned to the school, but to encourage it to be commonplace seems to be asking for a disaster."

t3_1wxy0c,cf6ij1q,"So while i guess it is immoral to eat meat, the fact of the matter is that millions of people do and hundreds of animals are killed for this meat, but like all industries, there is some waste, and it is often in grocery stores where the meat just isnt bought and ends up going bad."

t3_1wvths,cf5zw0f,"If you bring up a topic that is about you but not focused on your problems, both a talented therapist or an insightful patient can indirectly pinpoint some mental issues that need targeting that are not related to the breakup."
t3_1wvths,cf5zw0f,"It sounds a bit like ""an excuse to chat about yourself"", but in the same way a placebo is augmented by a white coat, or skin contact, or some mystical terms that appeal to you...some pointless psychological exercises actually can appeal to your insight in ways that direct conversation cannot."
t3_1wvths,cf60pmr,Dream analysis is more of a tool to steer the conversation with the patient towards introspection but at the same time sidestepping some objections that are making this harder otherwise.
t3_1wvths,cf60pmr,"And this is exactly what therapists do, only that some believe more in the technical benefits (something I agree with you doesn't work as intended), but most will agree it will serve the purpose of steering the therapy sessions in the desired direction."

t3_1wd6jq,cf1avu5,"The philosophy, the mathematics, and the physics butt heads on this topic."
t3_1wd6jq,cf1avu5,"The philosophy cares about whether the function exists, and declares free will nonexistent if it does; the mathematics says the function does exist; but the physics says the function can never be measured or even loosely approximated, and thus it might as well not exist."
t3_1wd6jq,cf1avu5,"The philosophy still makes the same assertion, but without the physics truly supporting it, its claim seems somehow meaningless, since assuming we do have free will counterintuitively makes our behavior more predictable."
t3_1w91jl,cezzr6g,"First of all, it's very problematic labelling any of what you're talking about 'black culture', but I guess we're going to have to use that as a shorthand."

t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,Now we may simply not have the full context of the situation and our assessment may be wrong but that would have more to do with lack of doing research on the video than our views of the video itself.
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"I agree it's a bit silly when we cheer people on for violence, even if it is self defense, for giving us that cathartic self righteous feeling but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with gender roles."

t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"I mostly agree with you, but it's important to remember that ""human morality"" both contains rules/guidelines about what we can morally do (that is, what rights other beings have), and what we should do."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"Thus, even though I agree that animals don't have rights because we have no reason to restrict ourselves in our dealings with them, in certain cases it is still in our self-interest to not treat them poorly - not out of consideration for them, but out of consideration for ourselves."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"Specifically, though factory farming and such are fine even when they cause animal suffering, it is because the suffering isn't the goal but an undesirable yet acceptable side effect of the real goal, which is relatively inexpensive food."

t3_1kcow1,cbnluty,Sad but true.

t3_1kag5w,cbmzov5,"We have some ideas of what things that are conscious look like at physical level (re brain structures), but we don't have a way (to the best of my knowledge) for being able to explain the existence of subjective conscious experiences."
t3_1kag5w,cbmzov5,"That is, we can learn of physical things, and even see that those physical things influence mental states, but we don't have an understanding of how physical things can produce the subjective conscious experience that we have - knowing neurons can form new connections doesn't necessarily tell us about the _experience_ of it."
t3_1kag5w,cbmzov5,"The physical can affect our subjective conscious experiences, but that by itself doesn't mean that our subjective conscious experiences can't also affect the physical, or that they must necessarily follow the same rules."

t3_1ka5uj,cbmxfh8,"Sure, within a decade or two, China may have an effective anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capability that will keep the US away from China's shores, but that still doesn't mean that China will be more powerful."

t3_1k3fd5,cblb6qd,"As to what I was saying regarding the problem building on itself, you said ""I don't want to go in them, but I'm not sure if it's because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice."

t3_1i94l9,cb29inp,One could try to be purely rational - maybe I should sacrifice myself to save this doctor since he will save many more lives - but I don't think that will sway many since our own lives are typically more subjectively valuable to us.
t3_1i94l9,cb29inp,"That sounds negative, but doesn't have to be - we tend to forget that we're going to die someday anyhow, and having a good (meaningful) death is something many value."

t3_1i6m7q,cb1p75z,"You might theoretically fix that problem by teaching year round, and injecting students into the system throughout the year, rather than having a summer break, and certain times when students are added to school, but there are good reasons why children and teachers benefit from getting a long break to catch their breath."

t3_1htdmd,caxz72q,I do like the idea of breaking up the 'too big to fail' companies but let me also offer another potential solution.
t3_1htdmd,caxz72q,The bailout pool should not try to keep the company in business or protect the investors but rather ensure the economically critical operations continue to be performed.
t3_1htdmd,cay2y0p,Corporations and industries continued to exist in more or less the same format but they were all owned by the government.

t3_1h3tmi,caqlx8h,"Atheists use their senses to say that there isn't a god, or they use logical statements to try and explain why there can't be a god, but all of that is based on THEIR understanding of what ""God"" is and what he should do."

t3_301n6h,cpoikva,"All in all, I would say it's not the most offensive thing ever since they did they research, but it's just another opportunity for Native actors to get into the spotlight and instead the mainstream media chooses white actors again and again."

t3_2vwn9m,coljf0b,"We decided those were important not because they're any more sacred than anything else, but because of the degree of discrimination that we've seen in the past, and because they're easy to identify."

t3_2vsa6d,cokgyrt,"Some families have rules like ""no politics at family gatherings"" and there's sometimes a taboo about discussing them in social situations, so I don't think what you're mentioning is unique to online posts - it's just that what we but online is broadcast, vs the direct face-to-face communication that is the norm."
t3_2vsa6d,cokgyrt,"Facebook is the next iteration of that, and I think we're still working out the etiquette, but the core truth remains that talking about current events is important - it makes us think, and it helps to make us educated."

t3_2vks7u,coin5gm,Also you say college athletes but what you really mean is football players (and maybe basketball players).
t3_2vks7u,coin5gm,I very much doubt that college's are giving high school golf prodigies special admissions (but I may be wrong).
t3_2vks7u,coiskjc,"Though football isn't a major (as far as I know), it definitely has the same goal, but unfortunately schools need to lower standards in order to get the best talent."

t3_2uj4yv,co8y43y,"So if the U.S. wants to maintain any kind of minimum level of worker/environment/whatever protection, it should do that on a federal level, and of course states can make stronger regulations if they like, but not weaker."
t3_2uj4yv,co8y43y,"I suppose a full on states-rights person might make the case that it should be a free for all, but I personally think that it would be... well, I don't like the word because of the way it's usually used these days, but I think it would be ""unamerican"" to have Mississippi or West Virginia to decide that they need more economy and legalize totally unsafe child-labor sweatshops."
t3_2uj4yv,co8y43y,"That was a long example, but I think things like this (things where competition fails to find the best result, or in fact aggressively finds the worst result) are places where it is good to have a strong federal government, and that these problems exist all over the place."
t3_2uj4yv,co8y43y,"In the real world, that would manifest itself in people overfishing waters until there are no fish left, and that is the normal result of everybody attempting to maximize their profit rationally, whereas the ""correct"" answer is for everybody to only fish as much as is sustainable, which actually increases their profit over time, but sustainable fishing is not a stable situation - any individual is highly incentivized to renege on their agreement with the others and fish more."

t3_2ubt5m,co70e85,"They were the kinds of bills legislators vote for to get campaign contributions from members of industry, not to put in their stump speeches."
t3_2ubt5m,co70e85,"The really very large campaign against them, which included but was not limited to online organized protests, made them sufficiently controversial to get shelved."
t3_2ubl1z,co70me4,"Both games feature very interesting level design, and the added powerups and world map items from 3 are a game-changing addition -- in a good way, obviously -- but it takes serious skill to actually get 100% completion in SMW, and there are quite a few surprises thrown your way as well."
t3_2ub8u9,co6t6k6,"Yes, but doesn't mean it was necessary for those benefits to happen."
t3_2u9e12,co6d4t4,"It wouldn't do anything except make Japanese people (and, frankly, many other people) angry that Japan is being punished (in a materially trivial but symbolically powerful way) for illegal whaling while many other countries go unpunished for much more serious crimes."
t3_2u8qcj,co670vd,"Battery is actually hurting someone, but assault is the threat of such."
t3_2u8qcj,co670vd,"We recognize that sights and sounds affect people just like touch can... you have to have some kind of evidence that words butt up against an impenetrable shield and do not affect people by default, unless they CHOOSE to let them in... that is simply NOT how communication has EVER worked."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"This equates to more money being distributed to other, less productive sports programs so that other student-athletes may benefit."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"Of course, there are academic scholarships, but they're given to very elite students, the same way scholarships are given to a few dozen elite athletes every year."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"There are many ways students may earn academic scholarships or funding, but when you have tens of thousands of students, all with strong high school performances, it becomes difficult."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"Of course many private schools are as well, but public schools are typically considered the big sports universities."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"present in collegiate athletics, but these are highly prohibited by bodies like the NCAA, and eventually it boils down to institutional ethics."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"I agree that some people seemingly don't care about their student athletes' academic performance, but that isn't always the case."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"The bottom line is that sports are definitely engrained in American college and our culture, but it doesn't have to diminish the academic side of things."
t3_2u7z7v,co63mr3,"It is not denying the Holocaust because it did happen, but there was no evidence for mass killings."
t3_2u7z7v,co66i08,The Auschwitz memorial said 6 Million but by the 50s it changed to 4 Million.
t3_2u7z7v,co66i08,Universities were debating it across the US(I don't know about other nation's universities) because it was taboo to discuss but now they have a valid claim to discuss it.

t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"This is mainly based on my personal experience having grown up in a French family and I'm also not sure if you mean the specific dishes and techniques of cooking or food culture in France in general; I'll talk about the culture: With globalization it is now harder to see the real contributions of individual societies, so I agree that saying today it is the best is at least inaccurate (and I don't believe one type of cuisine is the ultimate/best)."
t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"But as u/Account9726 mentioned, French cuisine has made some major contributions to other countries' daily cooking, so it is not always easy to notice."
t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"Of course that is also the case for Italian food, but France offers most diversity with comparable quality."
t3_2u6r1a,co5mc9d,"Blank/None of the Above/Re-open nominations (the latter should be an option in all elections: They each get an unaffected proportion of the vote OR (best case scenario) get a lower proportion of the vote and your opposition to both Hitler and Satan is recorded All that said, if you have a system where ""blank"" votes are simply discarded then yes, the vote is wasted, but that is not the voter's fault"
t3_2u6r1a,co5no9a,"Invalid votes do appear to be a waste, of course, but if records show only a fraction of those who showed up to vote actually supported a candidate, it does have a political significance."
t3_2u3ogv,co50x6x,"I could eat high calorie foods and then just go hungry to meet my daily calorie requirements, but then I feel like shit and I'm not as productive at work, I'm cranky towards my boyfriend, and I don't feel like hanging out with my friends."

t3_2txwe7,co3b93t,"Homeless people with experience know where to go for free food and clothes etc, but it's possible that the person on the street is totally new to being homeless."
t3_2txwe7,co3b93t,"If you were in that position you would take advantage of free food and institutions, but you would need more money if you were going to turn your life around and get out of your situation."
t3_2txwe7,co3b93t,"So your on the street but no one will give you any money because they think you will only spend it on drugs or alcohol - a stigma that has been created by a few homeless people, but you need to remember not all homeless people use drugs in the first place."

t3_2twq3l,co3iti4,"But, likewise, the British government has no choice but to follow their own laws in terms of honoring the rights of citizens."
t3_2twq3l,co3iti4,"It is your choice, but to say it's unreasonable on the part of the government to not want to be tied to individuals who are placing the nation's international interests in jeopardy is, well, silly."
t3_2tquws,co1iyez,"I completely agree with you that racism is a problem, not just in our country but the world."
t3_2tquws,co1iyez,"AA should be used, but IMO only in places/institutions where it is needed."
t3_2tpl0x,co19hbr,"In short, these schools might be bad for the gay acceptance movement as a whole, but they are also really good for individual gay kids who desperately need a place where they will be accepted."

t3_2tn8qu,co11da9,"There have been significantly fewer humans in the past than there are now, but we still managed to fight over scarce resources."

t3_2tf0y4,cnz2826,"Granted not everyone wants to be a parent, and some people are detrimental to the stability of their children, but that doesn't mean that they don't have the right to further their blood line."
t3_2tet25,cnydh7a,"Point 1, I definitely agree with wondering how on earth this whole thing could have got STARTED, but I think the books talk about how the Capital won some really brutal war so presumably the people in the districts had no choice in the matter."
t3_2tet25,cnydh7a,"They marvel at the barbaric customs and think that their strange ways are endearing, but they're disposable entertainment."
t3_2tet25,cnydh7a,"And on point 3, the books make it clear that some of the tributes are quite literally bred for the explicit purpose of taking part in the games."
t3_2tet25,cnydh7a,The rest of the district tributes are most certainly not happy.
t3_2tet25,cnydh7a,"Two against ten is better than one against eleven, and sure they have to get you eventually but you know that up-front."
t3_2tet25,cnygkjb,"We know they cause significant damage to people but we ignore that because we enjoy watching it, they seem to enjoy playing it, and those who do well are paid very generously."
t3_2tet25,cnygkjb,This is obviously a more brutal game but at the same time the Capitol residents are also more self-involved and disconnected to the people from the districts.
t3_2tet25,cnygkjb,You accept that they are okay with thousands dying from poverty in the districts but think the games are going too far?
t3_2tet25,cnygkjb,In the early games it was likely more common to go alone but in the later days they learned you had to have allies if you wanted to win.
t3_2tet25,cnygkjb,You can't trust each other but at the same time you can trust them more than you can the other alliances so you trust them.
t3_2td8d4,cny3yi2,"URL The industrial revolution was great, but you don't need capitalism to have an industrial revolution."
t3_2td8d4,cny3yi2,"The prosperity of the ""first world"" western nations was greater than the prosperity of the ""second world"" communist nations, but all these countries did better the ""third world"" nations."
t3_2td8d4,cny3yi2,Sometimes capitalism is best for technological progress but sometimes it is not.
t3_2td8d4,cny6ivo,"It is great if capitalism helps push technology forward, but it's not like technology just suddenly stops progressing in a government laboratory."
t3_2td8d4,cny6ivo,East Germany was worse than West Germany but a whole lot better than hyper-capitalist third world countries all over the globe.

t3_2t8798,cnwnpu9,"In terms of technology being created by the military, sure it may have been invented at some point down the line, but you can't be sure when or if this is actually the case and you can't know how fast or slow these innovations would have taken to create."

t3_2t6ote,cnwnwz0,I sincerely believe a lot of mistreatment and neglect can be attributed to a parent with mental health issues.
t3_2t6ote,cnw9vyp,Sure there are a lot of families looking to adopt babies but if a parent has proven they are unfit odds are they have done so by really screwing up the child.
t3_2t6ote,cnwc296,"I know, but none the less that is like saying the police can't imprison you for life."
t3_2t6ote,cnwc296,Technically it is the courts but the cops are the face of that system.
t3_2t6ote,cnwc296,Soldiers don't have the authority to start wars or pick which wars to fight but there is still a moral component on soldiers when going off to fight in a conflict as to the justice of the underlying cause.
t3_2t6ote,cnwdiha,I wouldn't support them but I would be saying we need to change our system.
t3_2t5d0k,cnw9ce5,"It can be a good thing, seeing that he's already done his time and a pardon can send a message that true rehabilitation is not only possible, but an absolute life change, and that you will find support from your society and legal system; that it does want to help, not retaliate."
t3_2sy7r5,cnubeuy,"When we honor MLK (to pick today's example) we aren't just remembering him but also JFK and LBJ, and the Freedom Riders, and Governor Wallace, and the police who shot firehoses at peaceful marchers, and everyone who filled the National Mall to listen to ""I have a dream..."", and thousands of others."
t3_2sy7r5,cnubeuy,"In the literal sense this isn't true, because being selfless is (past a certain low minimum) not something you get rewarded for or it would actually be selfish, but this sort of deification of moral heroes helps give people a sense that the world is a moral place."
t3_2svygx,cntyjr9,"It might bite him in the ass later, but it's not your life."
t3_2su6pz,cntesru,"For instance, Disney coming out with some all-CG movies is perfectly dandy, but when they shut down their 2D studios to focus entirely on the 3D stuff, then we have an issue."
t3_2su6pz,cnt8h1t,"I don't think that anyone really hates CGI in general, but its overuse."
t3_2su6pz,cnt8h1t,Many movie enthusists have grown tired of the use of nothing but CGI to get the job done.
t3_2su6pz,cnt8h1t,"Yeah, the CGI battles look incredible, but when they could, the team just used extras in classic prosthetics to do the orcs."
t3_2su6pz,cnt8h1t,"You use CGI for the things that physically cannot exist, but, when the shot, through angle or perspective, lets you use something practical, you take the chance."

t3_2s5c4b,cnnrb9q,"So then the question is who are we specifically trying to protect from offense, and why do they get that protection but other people don't?"
t3_2s5c4b,cnnrb9q,"That implies that we too are Muslims; I'm sure Muslims would find that reasoning sufficient to at least justify not saying such things themselves, but there are a lot of people who aren't Muslims, and unless you're planning to ban blasphemy against any and all religions (which is definitely not free speech) or openly favor one or more of them over the others for your own reasons (which certainly isn't equal treatment under the law), this just takes us back to the question of why we're banning speech that's offensive to Muslims."
t3_2s5c4b,cnnrb9q,"I can understand advising people to use their freedom of speech responsibly, but the freedom to be an obnoxious douche is required for speech to be free."
t3_2s38n0,cnm8elm,"Frankly, I don't think the comics were particularly insightful or funny, but the biggest tragedy in the support for Charlie Hebdo is that it didn't come sooner."
t3_2s11ys,cnl9jcv,"Are you sure what you want to argue for is living forever, as opposed to, say, a few thousand years, or maybe some other large but finite amount of time?"

t3_2s04yv,cnldfng,"Non-racism should not cause us to ignore how someone looks, or how people of their culture behave, but simply to give them respect."
t3_2ryflh,cnknbq4,"That's theoretically true, but if someone actually managed to read and recall every book ever written, it would be goddamn near impossible to not learn an immense amount from them."
t3_2ryflh,cnknbq4,"If the person in question read the books passively without remembering them, it'd be easy to say that they didn't properly learn and gain anything from them, but I find it absolutely impossible for someone to absorb and retain that much information without gaining a significant amount of intelligence."
