t3_2lvdpt,clyjeyd,"I'm not arguing that once an individual becomes 16, they 'magically mature' - I'm arguing that an adult who initiates a sexual relationship with an underage person is highly likely to be engaging in a relationship with an individual who is not yet physically and mentally mature, and that ultimately holds true regardless of claims surrounding the apparent promiscuity of boys vis-a-vis girls or the sex of the abuser. I can see where you're coming from, but ultimately we have to draw the line somewhere (barring some kind of system whereby medical practitioners individually assess people and legally declare their ability to grant consent). As things stand, the scientific consensus holds that an individual aged 14 or 15 is unlikely to have either completed physical growth or their full mental development (most critically, their ability to rationally determine consequential outcomes)."
t3_2j4itf,cla9i9a,"In the US, the US Government grants you the right to be free from government persecution, if you say ""The holocaust never happened."" In Germany, the German government does not grant you the right to say ""The holocaust never happened"", and sets penalties, if one violates your right ""Not to hear, 'The holocaust never happened'"". "
t3_2g1ea5,ckesi7g,"And NY does have good deep dish style pizzas (sold as sicilian slices normally). I'll grant you that a calzone can go more topping heavy, but at the expense of explosiveness and jaw-dislocation. A calzone will be taller than a pizza at any level of topping."
t3_2fu5da,cke4u4s,"Just because on principle, in a perfect world that doesn't exist, we should win without it? I personally agree that if sexuality was 100% a choice, we should still grant equal rights, exactly like religion. However, most other civil rights battles have been won for inherent traits."
t3_2ervii,ck2ndkx,"A big business isn't going to live under a bridge when it doesn't get a job, but an employee can't refuse to work just because everybody offers unhumane working conditions, he needs to pay for stuff. 2) In a ""free market"" it might not be worth 11$, but again a free market also wouldn't limit your working hours per day or would grant you days off. 3) How do you imagine decreasing the number of workers?"
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Done with a little back story. Now in the late 1800's, a man named Theodore Herzl started what is to be now known as political Zionism, which is a movement to grant Jew's their own state. Their books say they will be put through immense grief as a way of proving(?)"
t3_26b1l1,chpr7to,"It is also essentially a defense mechanism to avoid acknowledging a potentially offensive politically incorrect fact down the road. I'll grant that ""white"" is a social construct; in the past it was applied to different groups, and even nowadays there's probably more distance between a Greek and a Norwegian than there is between a Greek and an Arab (yet the Greek and Norwegian would be considered white, but the Arab would not be considered white), but that's at best a red herring. "
t3_1xzeag,cffzfv6,"So I would agree that 18 is too old to allow someone to start voting. I agree with your principle, though, that there are plenty of 8 year olds who are just as capable of making decisions like that as many adults that we grant the right to. "
t3_1xhgv0,cfbpidx,"Most of the time you find that they actually do accept evidence-based ways of obtaining knowledge, they only reject them when it contradicts their existing religion-based ideas about society. Most religious fundamentalists will grant that a detective can solve a murder case, which is evidence based knowledge in one of its most basic forms. Science is very similar, but has built a very complex case over a very long period of time about the way the universe works."
t3_1vbo8g,ceraqd2,"We shouldn't think about the government as having a ""right"" to privacy, because it doesn't. We should only grant it privacy if doing so is beneficial to the people. "
t3_1mjw31,cc9yys4,"Say what you want about Lost as a series, but it had some damn good individual episodes. Now these aren't examples of prequels, I'll grant you that, but they do demonstrate that you don't need the tension of an uncertain ending to make a compelling story. One final point - there have even been studied that suggest that knowing the ending can enhance one's enjoyment of a story."
t3_1j7p6i,cbby8gg,"Also, if you get health insurance through your employer (highly likely) it's not as bad as its made out to be. ""The aggressive nature of law enforcement""...I'll grant you a lot of cops are arrogant, but this isn't something you see in the vast majority of the US. 26 years and I've never had a problem with them."
t3_1htdmd,caxz72q,"Regulators may apply different standards to businesses they have a direct financial stake in. They might grant approval for certain business requests they normally wouldn't, turn a blind eye to environmental damage, approve a new drug prematurely, favor the business over another business in civil disputes etc. Another reason there has been resistance in the US to the government directly owning a stake in private companies is because there are some eerie similarities to how the economy of fascism works."
t3_1h5bo4,car096v,"Here's the juicy bit from pg. 25: States grant marriage licenses, not the federal government. So Kennedy's ruling essentially holds that the Federal Government cannot treat certain legally married couples differently than others."
t3_1h5bo4,car096v,"So again, this ruling does not render ""unconstitutional the uniformly applied right to marry someone of the opposite gender."" It merely holds that where States have deemed people to be married, the Federal Government should grant them the same marriage benefits. Let me know if I can clarify please."
t3_1am1gg,c8yp91p,"If you want an example of scientific advancement which had an incredible effect on the world, look no further than URL whose research resulted in avoiding world hunger. I would grant that the social change of wealth and high quality of life typically yields a slowing of population growth which assists in making these advances sustainable. At the same time, that is one of the beautiful parts of science where it works well in tandem."
t3_34s58u,cqxl63p,"If the companies are forthright about the ingredients used in food production/preparation, the nutrition information, and allow the consumer a free choice then the responsibility falls to the consumer to make the correct decisions. If there's no standard serving size, then I grant that it would be up to the consumer to do the math - I feel that it puts people off certain companies, but that's just my experience and what I've heard from a few others. There's the completely separate issue of food companies promoting benefits that the consumer can get from the food without any facts to back it up."
t3_33ltmy,cqmkixu,"I've done a few years of NGO work and I definitely know what you mean. I'm indeed Canadian, and about four years ago I was able to get a $1000 grant as a brand new NGO. Nowadays that grant doesn't even exist anymore."
t3_33ltmy,cqmkixu,"I'm indeed Canadian, and about four years ago I was able to get a $1000 grant as a brand new NGO. Nowadays that grant doesn't even exist anymore. Honestly, I recently had to shut down the NGO and not renew the license because it wasn't going anywhere without money, and I'm not going to be in Canada for the next few years anyway."
