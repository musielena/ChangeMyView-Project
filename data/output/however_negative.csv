t3_2qu6fg,cn9jqcy,"Your statement is generic so can be falsified with any example of something that is illegal and people get it less because of that and isn't more harmful than the banned product itself: - Guns in european cities - Explosives - Slaves - Child prostitution Making the above legal would create more problems than the current illegal situation. You used examples of things that turn our to be highly controversial, like abortion and some drugs, and in this case it has been the case that the ban has been more harmful than the product, however making this situation generic to ALL bans is a wrong extrapolation. "
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all. But you reiterate the notion again when you say: I don't understand at all the notion that Korra's relationship (however you choose to interpret it) in any way takes away from her strength or independence. Like, I honestly don't get what you're getting at here."
t3_2p3fdw,cmt0x8p,"i am one who occasionally backs into parking spaces. however, my first choice is always pull-through parking. how long it takes to pull into a spot isn't the only consideration for me but i sure as hell am not going to back in in a very busy situation."
t3_2oihml,cmnj7aa,"even then there are some kind of killings that can be seen as justified, like death penalty. however, cheating is not as clear cut. even in eastern cultures, that tends to have more homogeneity in each population, are quite split in this cheating issue."
t3_2nzz4f,cmigugj,"With that said, once he brought the indictment his duty demanded that he try his hardest to win, and so that seems like a violation of his duties. Cases with national media interest are the exception rather than the rule, however, and very few grand jury proceedings will suffer from this flaw. This case was a fluke in that regard, and not reflective on grand juries as a whole."

t3_2nokg9,cmfgdsv,"Despite it being a good idea in the long run. A good example is an old dog: One one hand you have an old dog you love to death, however would rather not see die. He's old and in much pain, and have the option to put him down."
t3_2mnpdh,cm65r7g,"Also, we are dealing in the realm of experimental social psychology, so I would hope you had proof that liberals are disgusted by the burning of books. It seems like your view is based primarily on what you think each category is like, however, you have no sources to promote your ideas, nor did you demonstrate your own study to provide evidence. I could be wrong on a few points as it has been awhile since I last read Haidt's articles, but they were not meaningless as you portray."
t3_2m34jb,cm0sbmk,"That's the biology. Socially, however, both men and women benefit from monogamy. The implicit purpose of sex is reproduction."
t3_2lclza,cltkxlu,"So even if let's say 30 percent of the people coming to a burger restaurant ordered a burger that came from an ethically treated animal it doesn't mean that the animal was actually treated better than a normal one. If however you (and a whole bunch of other people) decided to only order a vegetarian meal then you can know for sure that no animals were killed in the making of your food As for ""Second, an individual not eating meat makes zero difference, almost."" You could use that argument for almost anything ( voting, not polluting, etc.)."
t3_2kkqbm,clm9hyb,"As far as efficiency goes, Having kids is like having compound interest on everything you do, and it keeps adding up until the human race is extinct. Having a kid is not an easy way to ""get a high"", it IS however, extremely rewarding for the amount of effort put in. Having a child will also often drive a person to better themselves, and work harder at improving their community."
t3_2kacra,cljqwum,"All studies show that women earn less. There are however many very convincing ""opinion columns"" and articles written by conservatives that blame the wage gap on ""women's choices"" such as preferring to work fewer hours or different careers. While those reasons are a part of the wage gap, they are just a part, and in reality, a large portion of the differences in hours worked and job position is caused by employer discrimination in hiring and promotions."
t3_2k4hym,clhv3j1,"I certainly won't argue for chess being a sport, and golf has already been covered. Darts and pool/snooker (depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on) on a competitive level, however, require immensely precise fine motor control and hand-eye coordination--purely physical qualities. While they lack the element of strength and conditioning present in other sports, I think that still puts them squarely in the same category, along with archery and shooting sports."
t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"Some black people could take offense at being called black, similarly to how an Asian may take offense to being called yellow. ""African American"", however, is universally accepted as being the politically correct way to refer to someone of that race (as well as Asian American). Another thing is that your idea of equality appears to involve ignoring the existence of any race at all."
t3_2ia3iy,cl0blaz,"Recognize the tradeoff- rather than being an expert in one or two fields, you'll simply be competent in four. I did something similar myself (not to that extent, however), and as I went on to graduate school, there were many things that I wanted to do that I simply didn't have the experience for, because I spent my time becoming more well-rounded. Think ""Jack of all trades, master of none""."
t3_2eqf4w,ck21hrp,"However, human lives have more value. I have pet cats, so the idea of sewing their eyes shut disgusts me... however, I also recognize that the research provided valuable insights into brain development that couldn't have been accomplished any other way. Groups like ALF just aren't very effective."
t3_2epkxz,ck1q92g,"Do you think being aware of them makes you a sexist? It's not racist to identify legitimate differences between members of various races, it's racist to assume all members of that race are a certain way or should be treated a certain way because of some generalization you've made about the group, or that people can be ranked from ""best"" to ""worst"" based on race, however defined. We can recognize diversity without being racist."
t3_2e6gdd,cjwqho0,"They're not making monetary profit from it by people seeing it as the viewers are most likely not enjoying it or viewing it multiple times. Child pornography, however exploits children for the entertainment of others, so it's producers are profiting from the suffering of others because their consumers are viewing the products multiple times.

t3_2dgu6l,cjpngal,"I see what you're saying. It does often have to do with employers, however you're overlooking the small business / freelancing community. In the film industry for example, that community is massive."
t3_2d4iry,cjm7yyk,"""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" laws have been instituted in some jurisdictions to protect minors in situations where both parties are under the age of consent. They're inapplicable, however, when one of them is in an authoritative position over the other, or in cases where the age spread is more than a specific number of years (generally 3). These laws are in place to not just protect minors from being exploited by adults, but also to make it easier to prosecute cases of forced or coerced sex between an adult and a minor by taking consent out of the equation and disallowing the defense to claim it."
t3_2d45gd,cjm4puq,Do they have to line up to order and get a drink? It seems like it would be easier to just stay at home and cook rather than have to queue for however long it takes to get this done in a crowded restaurant. Also it would mean the chef has to keep taking people's orders instead of cooking the food.
t3_2cz5rq,cjkjx53,"I don't want a home to make as large of a profit as possible by selling it, I want a home so that I can do what I want with it, whether that involves building a tree house in the back yard, or ripping out the lawn and replacing it with a very large garden that provides all my vegetable needs for half the year. I want to paint it any damn color I please, and decorate it however I wish. I do not want other people telling me what things are acceptable for me to do."
t3_2ctoax,cjiw921,"But we transcend all of that because we are magical beings. Of course, you may not believe that, however, it does fit into the hypothetical situation which you have described. The authors of the bible were telling us a parable to explain why the world is such a mess."
t3_2c8fea,cjd2c3b,"Of course there are going to be options available to her. If a man does not want a child, the onus is on him to prevent that happening, however he needs to. When he fails to do so, is is accepting the risk that his actions may result in a child being born."
t3_2b1rab,cj0zinx,"Whether you've got a rare steak ""bleeding"" on the plate, or mashed potatoes smeared all over and no longer in an neat pipetted floret, once you dig in the presentation is ruined anyways. I used to work at a steakhouse and never witnessed to be true, however, I could understand why this might happen. A ""worse cut"" might have more exterior fat, less internal marbling, be a less-ideal shaped cut (long and thin instead of short and fat), or might be a tougher end cut with more connective tissue."
t3_2atkq9,cizde8p,"So yes, I think to some extent you are right, most of the examples in the song can technically be considered ironic. I think the problems most critics have with the lyrics, however, is that the examples of irony used don't fit society's general idea of what irony is. If you look at the definition of irony, it says ""A state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result."""
t3_29n4wo,cimnxth,"I am going to more address your post title as opposed to the longer description (because you have a number of very reasonable and points of personal opinion which you are perfectly entitled to). At the heart of the matter however is the question of high standards in a relationship. The only point I would make is that if you want a relationship, as opposed to simply someone to enjoy a good time with, what distinguishes those things is that a relationship allows you to share more parts of your life with someone than the simple good ones."
t3_29mv5t,cimm4sj,"You don't believe in a right to abort, but you also do not believe there is a legitimate government power to prohibit abortion. Non prohibitive attempts to reduce abortion would be acceptable, however. In short, I think atheist libertarianism commits you to a certain ethic of moral pluralism in government action."
t3_298qie,ciipym4,"So in the end it's subjective: you probably don't think queues are onerous at all, so your bar experience wouldn't be diminished by waiting in one. For most other people, however, queues impose structure that they're deliberately trying to avoid by going to a ""fun"" place like a bar. And to hammer this point home: notice how bars and clubs always have queues outside the door if they're at capacity?"
t3_295zr6,cihuma6,"People did the same exact things as they do now, minus the internet. Now, however, people are at least exposed to multifarious beliefs, communities, and cultures. They can choose to ignore them, if they so wish, but repeated exposure is a far more effective and ongoing method of learning than you give it credit for."
t3_28sivx,cie3rwm,"So although thought of as socially unacceptable it is a stereotype and the idea of a boy seen in the same light playing the game is not outside the comprehension of most people. A girl playing it however is something to remark upon, something to treat her as different for. It drives girls away from the sport at early ages."

t3_26uqns,chur6nz,"The means of accomplishing the settlement of Israel may seem harsh but at the benefit of less bloodshed despite conflicting interests, I think it's just. Israel has started conflicts, in part simply by Jews emigrating there and wanting to live their lives, and it is naive to think otherwise, however it is important to consider the morality of their emigration and the resultant conflict. I think that the Jewish people has a moral right to live in the land of Israel."
t3_26nayb,chsv92t,"If it is more difficult for a woman to gain your trust than it is for a man to do so, even when you not sexually interested in either party, it looks bad. Recognizing that there may be a problem is the first step to fixing it however. * Your preferences regarding intimacy and long term relationships are a completely unrelated issue."
t3_26b1l1,chpr7to,"Race denial is a form of doublethink. It is not unscientific to make a category, however fuzzy, of people who are aggregate related, and to then theorize on possible common traits between said group. To put it bluntly, for someone to acknowledge that the category ""blacks"" (meaning Sub-Saharan Africans or ""Negroids"") are more prone to sickle-cell anemia, and then saying race doesn't exist in the same breath is committing a form of doublethink."
t3_26avz4,chpens6,"If so, interesting, but to my knowledge they do not. The pie crust however is a delivery system. Why else do we value crust based on very particular properties."
t3_25x7qp,chlyib1,"You don't have to understand why other people sleep around, you just need to accept that they do. As long as you don't use your judgement to control the actions and choices of others, you can feel however you want about sex! :) It sounds like you have your own feelings/awkwardness/wonderings about sex and that may be getting mixed up in your judgement and perceptions of others."
t3_25x7qp,chlyib1,"I'd recommend reading some more sex positive blogs and feminist writing about sex to see how others perceive sexuality as a positive thing, and can have multiple sexual partners without feeling that it denigrates them. But you can still make choices for your life however you want, even if that means sex with one person for life. "
t3_25lg8m,chiogt6,"If you capped Bill Gates' salary, he may not be motivated to aid in creating better, more efficient technologies. He wouldn't be working to bring clean water to 3rd world countries, and when he dies, you'd be depriving a whole bunch of charities and foundations $50 billion (or however much he's worth at the time). Because you think there's some arbitrary standard of morality, some poor kid in Kenya dies because he couldn't get clean water."
t3_25l0uy,chi7tu1,"I'm not sure that even if you are able to fend the dog/wolf off to the point where it retreats, that that would constitute winning I think a lot depends on your definition of 'win', if just remaining alive is winning then you may be correct, .. however, as you already alluded to, you are very likely to be bitten, and probably pretty badly..

t3_24xvdh,chbz1m4,"Spreadsheets do a lot of things that databases don't. Spreadsheets do it in a different way, however. Why is it a good idea for more people to code?"
t3_24v147,chbf3nm,It would be designed to make any coffee I thought of. It would brew for however long I wanted. It would bend to my every whim.
t3_24c1q3,ch68v3s,"Shaved may be a fetish, but if it reaches a certain popularity, which arguably it has, then it isn't by what we classify as a fetish, but rather a preference. Bad teeth, boils, father time beards, uni-brows, body odor, etc, are ""natural"" yet the majority of people go to great lengths to avoid these and if you don't bathe then however ""natural"" you are it people will be turned off by it. Naturalistic fallacy."
t3_23o885,cgyyncp,"Truth be told I'd rather it was America than Russia or China but that's somewhat beside the point. The only way it can do this, however, is by having something called projection. That means that it can put soldiers into any field in a pretty short period of time."
t3_23kv7b,cgy6k1w,"Some people can not pull apart the consciousness from the carbon based husk that now sits before them, and this provides them with closure they need to move on. It is, however, not only illogical, but I can not help but inject a personal emotional response that it is entirely selfish for the reasons you've described. Someone special to you is dead beyond repair, and instead of saving one or more lives with the now otherwise useless organs, we should let others die so someone can look pretty after they no longer inhabit this lifeless lump?"
t3_235swt,cgtxn77,"Taxes pay for public infrastructure, police and fire coverage, and government programs involved with environmental and product safety that safeguard the lives of citizens. Even beyond that, however, mere participation in the market makes money available for companies to find new and better options for treating, curing, and protecting people. Setting both of those points aside, the U.S. provides a disproportionate share of biomedical research in the world, so merely by doing exactly what it's been doing the U.S. has done much to see to the ""health and care"" of every person in the entire world with access to modern care."
t3_22y28i,cgrjo9h,"A person can kill himself by putting a gun to his head. however a person can also be used as an instrument to end ones life. I think it's bad to force a person who doesn't want to live any more to use a gun to blow his brains out, when there is an option where he can die respectful."
t3_22itbs,cgnaaux,"Anarcho-pacifists argue that this is the case, that all violence is hierarchical. Most anarchists, however, are not pacifists, and would argue that such an act would not be oppressive - it would be just. In fact, such an act would be crucial in the defense of communities in an anarchist society."
t3_217z08,cgam4in,"You overlook the fact that men and women are different in ways other than pregancy/not-pregancy and have avoided the opportunity of a varied, stable and strong workforce all for the sake of what is a minor problem in long run. I think it's obvious that this is not a logistic problems, however logical you may find it, but rather a moral one. And one, I suspect, you are very stubborn in holding on to because the way you work now, I have no doubts, probably does work."
t3_20y74d,cg7xgcc,"The Jewish God is hard to understand. If you accept the Torah, however, then you accept that He made the world and is in charge of everything that happens on it. His interventions change significantly with time too becoming less and less dramatic."
t3_20jx3a,cg3zhj7,"Nationalism can vary from simply being national pride or patriotism (which are generally seen as being positive attitudes) to rampant bigotry and parochialism whereby anything ""foreign"" is vilified and rejected (Nazism/Fascism are extreme examples of this). Nationalism is linked either directly or implicitly to racism(which you did as well), however, if the word is used without judgement the positives are: 1. Patriotism and national pride."
t3_1ysjvs,cfnjy06,"It certainly helps to relate to his characters if you've gone through similar experiences but even if you did completely relate, you might still not like his works. Part of what makes Kafka great however is that many people do find that he expresses their frustration with being unable to coexist. And remember this was published almost 100 years ago so while he wasn't the first or only to tell these kinds of stories he was still something of a pioneer."
t3_1yksrs,cflsynk,"Lesser actors in a free market will always seek to influence the state's monopoly on force to hinder competitors. What i hear you saying, however, is we need regulations for our regulations. I would prefer a state immune to these kinds of influences."
t3_1yjpzs,cfl5l62,"As for whether people should own dangerous animals as pets, that's a reasonable statement. It isn't limited to reptiles, however. Big cats and many dogs can be dangerous to children and adults just as much as pythons and cobras."
t3_1yg2jo,cfk729g,"It is absurd. Now, maybe you can't condem people for a belief system, however, you certainly can for the actions that result from it. Should pedophiles be able to rape kids because they believe there is nothing wrong with it?"
t3_1xzeag,cffzfv6,"What you're essentially saying, since we know this to be the case, is that people with more kids (or kids at all) get to have more say in how things are run in this country, which actually runs totally contrary to the principle of ""one person, one vote"", because now it becomes ""one person, 5 votes"" if you can pop out five kids. I would agree that the voting age should be lowered, however, to something more like 13 or 14. By that age, we are expected to start contributing to society, and treated as adults in the eyes of the legal system."
t3_1xx4hd,cffiomi,"And this is a primary work skill that is important in all but the most menial jobs.

t3_1we5ye,cf1drrq,I am extra cautious when it is a 2 way stop sign because a car I don't notice isn't going to be stopping for me. I rarely run red lights however. I generally feel that there is too strong a chance that someone will speed through the green and kill me.

t3_1voenh,ceu9m4y,"So man breast isn't a taboo area of conversation, people wouldn't be like to perceive it as a sexually aggressive move for a woman to touch a man's chest/man boob. Woman Ass vs Man Ass -- this one's a little harder to break down, however, I think most of the issue with this comes from the social perception of who is normally the sexual aggressor, i.e. the one who initiates flirting and/or sex."
t3_1vloic,cethv0j,"I can get on the road when I know it's unsafe. Neither the law nor common sense would actually prevent me from the free exercise of my will; they would, however, dictate the consequences of my choices. If you accept that knowledge of the consequences constitutes a restriction, independent of the ability to exercise one's free will in the sense that a human can choose to perform any action they can perform, then both the law and the external risk of death or injury qualify as restrictions."
t3_1vhh7b,ceso4j1,"There would also have to be an entirely new authority system for working on local roads, though I suppose that is a bit easier. You could either incorporate them into the military (however, not all of them would want to be soldiers), retrain them, or put them on other construction jobs. It would probably cause some unemployment, though."
t3_1umi67,ceju0k7,"It was locked through the spokes, with URL of lock, not linked to some place else. It's pretty hard to get the bike to work without seriously damaging it, however it looks like its not even locked to people unfamiliar with that type of lock. Good chance people just threw it in the back of their pickup and only noticed at home that they were in for half an hour of angle grinding."
t3_1ty0ux,ceckou4,"Lastly, concentrating on overweight/obese is important. One thing that really surprised me however is that using the BMI definitions, being overweight did not correlate to a higher incidence of heart disease or cardiac problems when compared to normal weight. So really ""overweight"" in terms of BMI anyway isn't that bad."
t3_1tqttm,ceakm2y,"The next problem is pretty much exactly what you said: animals are generally not moral agents because they don't have a conception of morality. We do however, so pointing to an amoral agent can do nothing to inform us, as moral agents, how we should act. That's the equivalent of pointing to a sociopath and going ""Well he doesn't have a problem with serial killing, so I shouldn't either!"""
t3_1rw7vg,cdrq6vt,"&lt;That being said, would it not be better, if you have an overarching egalitarian viewpoint, to operate under egalitarianism so that you don't get caught up in your bias? You'll primarily, still want females to get their rights moreso than anything else, however you would end up helping other groups while dealing with your issues rather than walking overtop of them in pursuit of your own needs and desires. Also under no-bias framework would the solutions you come up with end up being a lot more beneficial in the sense of long-term solutions?"
t3_1rgch2,cdn0d35,"If you believe that justice is only served if the perpetrator suffers as much as the victim, then I suppose your view might make sense. Many people, however, believe that the punishment is related to how dangerous the criminal is, rather than how much the victim is damaged. If you believe that the purpose of prison is to rehabilitate a criminal, serve as a deterrent to others, and to keep the criminal away from society for a time so they can't commit another crime, then ""intent"" absolutely has to be considered."
t3_1r452i,cdjfd1i,"There are certain sectors where free-market is necessary and I fully support, but healthcare, especially for a developed nation with the available funds and infrastructure, should be a basic human right. That, however, has very little to do with equality. "
t3_1qfqj6,cdcgve9,"Good for them/us. Native Americans have good reason not to see it that way, however.

t3_1ptwcr,cd63zq4,"The aftermath of this incident would produce lasting tensions with China and potential instability in the region if North Korea's nuclear program was not properly contained after the country's defeat. The North Korean dictatorship would likely fall in the event of any potential invasion by an international coalition; however, this victory would only be achieved after the partial destruction of Seoul and after heavy wartime casualties.

t3_1ppyu1,cd5an9q,"I wouldn't necessarily say that's true. The complexity or plot of a story is independent of however we define the constituent characters. No matter how you define antagonist and protagonist, you can still write a story from the protagonist's POV."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"They can both pick to co-operate or defect. Co-operative play gives both players 3 points (the ""Reward"", R), however, if one defects and the other co-operates, the defector gets 5 points (the ""Temptation"", T) and the co-operator 0 (the ""Sucker"", S).

t3_1pdul1,cd1jphb,"You have no way to know you will never interact with someone again unless you intend on killing them after the conversation is complete.

t3_1l3hck,cbvffz9,"Why focus on the word? Using the word shows a lack of empathy on their part; however to them, you're ""just nagging"" about a ""bad word""; once you can make people stop using the word the important battle has already been won (people having empathy for a group of people they once considered sub-human) To be effective you should get in peoples face and ask them ""is being gay that big an insult?"" and embarrass those who would dare say yes by backing them into some sort corner."
t3_1kwoib,cbtlv0w,"Our things can easily be destroyed, but our genes are essentially immortal. I do personally believe in an afterlife, however, I cannot prove it so I am not going to try to argue it. But the reason why we are so driven to have sex is because our genes, our animal instinct wants to reproduce."
t3_1kpmvy,cbrg01p,It will probably take another generation for this to degenerate into a romantic fantasy. I can't see it being connected to rape alarmism however. 3.
t3_1kmwmn,cbqlofq,"As things change, there will always be many things which are referred to as conservative which seem to be outdated. That does not mean that whatever changes are happening are automatically good, however. Nor that everything anyone labeled as a conservative has lumped in with them is automatically bad."
t3_1kkl0k,cbpwrwm,"In all honestly, my father would probably count as a member of that elite. His parents, however, worked in a car factory for generations and discouraged him from going to college because it would hinder his chances at getting a job with the rest of his family. Of the 10 richest people in America, seven made their wealth themselves, and the three who inherited it are first generation rich (the children of the Walton family, Wall-Mart)."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"I agree it's a bit silly when we cheer people on for violence, even if it is self defense, for giving us that cathartic self righteous feeling but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with gender roles. It seems to me however that you think this is ridiculous because you may still be attached to the perception that for some reason women are weaker or more fragile than men, which is a sexist assumption to make. Don't worry, I do it myself, but just like every other gender stereotype we would probably benefit from moving on."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"My mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) I gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her. She likes her laptop a lot, she says she prefers it to the tablet, but she still uses the tablet more as it's more convenient."
t3_1k3fd5,cblb6qd,"I'm an international student, I can have not the absolute best grades but if I apply internationally to the US I am much more likely to be noticed than if I was your 'average' white american male with the same grades. I agree with you on religious intolerance in the US, however it is sadly worse in a lot of other first world countries. Religion is sadly one of those things that is still in the grey area, many times because people are ignorant about it, not necessarily because they are prejudiced to it."
t3_1jmadm,cbg3yyk,"I guess my phrasing is poor. The mother should always have a right to right to remove the fetus from her body, however, if it is possible to remove it without killing the fetus, then abortion shouldn't be allowed. "
t3_1j9xnf,cbcvqxh,"URL Make no mistake about it, the ROKR was made by the same engineers who worked on the iphone. When they made the iphone however, Steve had a different mindset. >*Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make."
t3_1ia3zd,cb2h5ll,"Personally, I would prefer if the usage of ""more"" and ""as many as"" was clarified. ""Four time more apples"" should not be the same number as ""four times as many apples"" however it's pointless to argue against how the phrase is commonly used. I do not think that grammar nazism has had a significant effect on cultural phrasing or spelling in general, which is what you seem to suggest."

t3_1h9sqe,cas8g4g,"If you haven't already, I urge you to read over URL This is true, but like I was just saying, vim is not a tool designed for user-friendliness, it's designed for raw efficiency. There is however extremely comprehensive help files, so if you want to know something you can usually type `:h &lt;topic>` and get some useful information. Edit: I forgot to mention, if you're using stock gVim, it does come with menus by default, if you want to use them to get used to the keybinds."
t3_1h2wxx,caqen9z,"Of Course the insurance companies are able to price premiums in a way they always stay profitable. You however get the benefit of piece of mind, knowing if the worst happens you are covered. Auto insurance is important because most people couldn't afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you."
t3_1h2wxx,caqen9z,"Auto insurance is important because most people couldn't afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you. All insurance is probably considered negative lifetime equity, however they are important in helping people avoid financial disasters. One massive car accident, home fire or medical claim could bankrupt you and your family."
t3_1gtewi,cannxmk,"So your argument is that misogynistic dating advice for men is okay in light of the fact that there is a major deficit in dating advice for men, and that ""nice guys"" can find help there? Yes there is a deficit in dating advice for men and for now the seduction community is the only resource of decent size available (although there are other less misogynistic sources available), however, this does not justify nor atone for the misogynistic attitudes of the community. The advice is still misogynistic, even if it is helping people like you, because the possibility is always there that it could be non-misogynistic."
t3_1gndd7,cam0we6,"So this creates an awkward dynamic where everybody takes certain things as assumptions, but then claims that these assumptions are the result of scientific progress and doubting what is accepted. These assumptions, however, basically follow from the premises that lots of people accept, so they aren't the result of self-reflection and deep philosophical discourse. But I don't think that you are unreflective or haven't studied philosophy."
t3_1fthzm,cadpyxu,"The cause isn't because a person is black or white though. Being young ,however, does have a direct impact on how good a driver you are likely to be though, due to the way the brain develops. "
t3_1fafn1,ca8c6l7,"By saying the ends justify the means, you are saying that a person may ignore what society has decided is right based solely on what they perceive to be right . You are, in effect, saying that each person is welcome to define morality however suits them, since the ""ends"" are valued according to them. Even if you (somehow) construct a situation where society at large has equal participation in both means and ends, there is still a temporal argument to be made; i.e."
t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"On the other hand, perhaps a pragmatist viewpoint will win out; just use what appears to work and is useful in practice. I agree that the inspiration to work on foundations of mathematics could be said to come from philosophy, however this gets into the issue of where mathematics starts and philosophy ends. This is not necessarily an accurate complete picture in my view."
t3_1e30x9,c9x7bnj,"No one should have their prospects in life depend on the whims of the market and placing middle class youth in that position has the potential of putting the reality of our economy in perspective. The perspective you seem to be advocating, however, places them in the position of simply having failed to adapt to the market. People should take responsibility for themselves, but the market, as a social entity, should be held responsible as well."
t3_1e30x9,c9wbvj3,"Another reason that people major in the humanities and social sciences is NOT because of a natural disability in physical sciences, or possibly even a natural dislike for the subjects. Post-Cold War America's trend of increasing demand for technological skills and better equipment has not changed, however, the government sponsored push for quality educational tactics and funding most definitely did. You see, the arms race with the Soviets included not only nuclear warheads, but a struggle to produce the biggest bunch of smartest technical minds that the superpowers could extract from their populations."
t3_1dr38j,c9t3tv5,"The only thing that sways people's mind is the enjoyment they get from the product which is similar to a lot of things we do that are bad for the environment. I would, however, question the economic effects of losing the beef industry. It is one that supports a lot of communities globally from farming to the service industry."
t3_1dmdji,c9rvfop,Ignorance indeed has no place in a proper discussion. Basics however are often the best things to start reasoning from since they open up pathways for logical reasoning and thinking. 
t3_1dahpy,c9ohbfe,"If your argument were only that drinking is a bad activity when pursued to the extent that one's judgment becomes irresponsibly impaired and harm to others becomes a strong possibility, I think you'd have a very strong case. The choice of others to drink because it makes them happy, however, even if they are capable of doing it responsibly and their choice to drink does not harm anyone else, is much more difficult to justify. Can you assert that drinking socially does not make others happy, or provide them with enjoyable experiences?"

t3_1cxteo,c9l1cnw,"One of the things I think you have wrong is that I don't think fixing any one problem is the answer--on a global scale, problems like climate change come from a hundred thousand smaller problems, of which polluting is just one. | however not so for most other pollutants. Again, my point is that these things have effects that we don't know or understand."
t3_1cskpb,c9jlje5,"I disagree on account that, before the age of 18 you are not considered an adult yet. Children in highschool think that they're mature and that who they vote for now, will be the same way they think in 4 years however that's probably not the case. I don't feel they're intelligent enough yet, or have the experience necessary."
t3_1ayifp,c91y4yc,"Some can handle keeping in touch, others can't. That doesn't mean, however, that you shouldn't pursue a relationship because you can't answer ""what's the point?"" Third point: Caring for the social sphere's worries is unsubstantiated if you are thinking superficially."

t3_1am1gg,c8yrmeo,etc. however when ur looking at state funded education; these skills like engineering are very fact checked; a communist bridge builder and and anarchist bridge builder; kinda would both agree on the basic ideas of gravity and the shape of a bridge when u have a history major u dont know if they thought fdr helped or harmed the great depression

t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"You only start paying income tax when you cross the £10k boundary. You do, however, IIRC pay NI contributions even when you are under the £10k mark. This is a game British politicians love to play, they make all sorts of promises about income tax while conveniently forgetting that people also pay NI contributions which, in a way, act as a second income tax."

t3_317c4q,cq08xc2,"The reason for the Allied defeat in the Battle of France was, infamously, the passage through the Ardennes of a German army and its breakthrough at Sedan, trapping the Belgian army, the BEF, and the best part of the French army near the coast. The Maginot Line, however, resisted all attacks, and actually many of the garrisons stubbornly refused to surrender even after the armistice. When the Italians invaded the French border, even the much less adequately defended Alpine line of forts held them at bay."
t3_316pae,cpyu50o,"Everyone might be more economically equal today, but if everyone is getting poorer together, especially relative to the world, it is inevitably going to bring those rankings down in the long-term because worldwide development doesn't stop.

t3_309bvo,cpqbaln,"As a PS4 owner of over a year now, literally the only game exclusive to that console that I enjoy is InFamous: Second Son, and even that got boring fairly quickly. It was a step in the right direction however, as developers are getting used to new hardware. When they use that hardware for remasters instead, it just proves to me that upgrading my console was completely pointless, as I have nothing new to play."
t3_309bvo,cpqbaln,"Example: I bought Last of Us in 2013 at launch. A year later, they release a superior version (however little) of the game. So, now I can't play the better version, because I bought their game at launch?"
t3_306b19,cpqv22p,"I think it's both very informative and interesting. If we stopped all of the actions that were contributing to global climate change right now, the current processes heating the planet wouldn't immediately stop; however they would peak and slow down. The idea I've had explained to me is that if we stop things that are outputting CO2 such as using our oil fuelled vehicles, which produce 19 pounds of CO2 per liter of gas used while driving according to URL we have a chance of stopping the increase in temperatures before the positive feedback loops become uncontrollable."

t3_2vayhb,cog18c4,"They absolutely were not the most technically sound, and the recordings sound (for the most part) very rough. This, however, was the point - punk culture at the time was about going against the grain, doing something different from the mainstream. Think about how back in those days there was no internet, cable, satellite, cell phones.. All music was generally consumed over the radio and nearly all stations were playing the same glossy tunes (disco, soft rock, weak pop)."
t3_2v0u7q,codo2ac,"I'm not saying that his behavior has any bearing on his claim. Pointing out the irony is however, valid criticism to his continuing behavior of binge-drinking. The criticism is effectively a new argument (against his binge-drinking), and distinct from the claim he made."

Two main problems with that, however, is how do you determine where AA is 'needed' and this approach takes time, like generations of time, before you can see results. In a way, this is exactly what different races have always done since globalization began."
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8yko,"It's a stubborn place, but it's lost much of its unique character, and is fighting to hold onto what is left. That said, however, change is the only thing that's certain, and what you think of as quintessentially ""Seattle"" or ""London"" or ""Berlin"" may not jive with what someone who lived there in the seventies thinks of as quintessential. Things fall out of fashion because they don't work, or no longer work."
