t3_2qmhw7,cn7hxwe,"Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex. In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex. The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"A lot of other commenters are talking about the comparison you're making to the the glorification that Rock ""legends"" like Hendrix and The Stones have gotten. However, consider that their heyday was the 60's and 70's, whereas hip hop didn't really hit it's stride until the early 90's. I'd make a side point here that many early 90's genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition, and that's often for artists/styles that are effectively dead and gone (re: nirvana)."
t3_2orvv0,cmq2y7j,"Each culture has an opinion on when a human is perfectly autonomous, and most dole out rights and responsibilities slowly throughout maturation. In parts of the world it's considered fine for URL , whereas most western children aren't allowed to use the microwave until they're a young teen. There's no biological and objective point at which it is safe for children to hunt tarantulas - it's just arbitrary cultural convention."
t3_2lclza,cltluz5,"And as far as fighting for something achievable through what they're doing, vegetarians/vegans help make vegetarianism/veganism more socially acceptable and a more accessible option for everyone else, thus making it easier for others to reduce or eliminate their meat consumption. Why is it that getting a restaurant to offer more vegetarian options makes no difference, whereas getting a restaurant to offer meat from a more humane supplier makes a big difference? I would argue both make a difference."
t3_2ko5tx,cln523m,"And lastly, the term ""healthy"" is relative. What is healthy for someone trying to lose weight is to be extremely conscious about every calorie they put in their body and eliminate as many unnecessary ones, whereas a body builder's ""healthy"" is taking in as much protein and fat. The term is used in a blanket fashion which is why we get people that are 10 pounds underweight thinking they need to go on low carb diets because it is ""healthy."""
t3_2jp9x4,cldt2z1,"What you are essentially talking about is ""front office"" vs. ""back office"" work. Front office work generates revenue, whereas back office work is a cost needed to run the front office. Front office means sales, developing new products, and making relationships with clients."
t3_2jp9x4,cldt2z1,"Very few people offer to give us cash directly, and when they do, we value those relationships highly. The non-working spouse is in the former category, whereas the working spouse is in the latter. Luckily, most people base their relationships on love and mutual trust/respect, and not on rote financial value."
t3_2jd1e2,clal24g,"And everyone is doing the same numbers. An episode of breaking bad, one of the most critically lauded shows of all time might get a 1.8 whereas in a local market here an episode of Arrow might do the same just cause that's what's on. Since so many shows get the same numbers but some get more hype than others, a salesperson has to convince advertisers why their show might fit the client better."
t3_2gutfw,ckmsso5,"The differences between a Tamil and a Punjabi are gigantic. The Punjabi language is closer to English than to Tamil, because Punjabi and English are Indo-European languages whereas Tamil is a completely different language group: Dravidian. But in any case, I think races are a total fiction."
t3_2g2dg1,ckf6526,"Reddit frontpage isn't either (albeit slightly better than YT). It's a bit different here with iPhone vs ""Android"" because iOS is exclusive to the iPhone whereas Android phones have multiple manufacturers.

t3_2g1ea5,cker9hn,"Calzones demand much deeper boxes and are narrower, making it difficult to transport a large number -- if you have one per box, you quickly wind up with a tower, and if you have multiple per box the boxes are fairly large. Ah, but pizza can be pre-sliced without any serious aftereffects, whereas pre-slicing a calzone removes many of the benefits you mentioned -- the calzone will cool much more rapidly, and worse, unevenly. In addition, the cheese and ingredients will likely escape the confines of the calzone a bit."
t3_2d9xj4,cjnit4x,"Under mushrooms it's not even staying in the same place if I'm not looking directly at it. I can guess to maybe within 30 seconds or so when 5 minutes pass (and again, not some bullshit ""consensual reality"" thing - we can count the vibrations of a quartz crystal under electric current and know objectively what 5 minutes is), whereas under mushrooms, I seriously watched the time go from 5:00 to 5:30 minute by minute, each minute lasting what felt like hours and hours (though the entire half-hour seemed to have gone by in a few minutes after the 30 minutes were up).

t3_2ba26t,cj3fyrg,"For many of the 'acceptable' system users, they might rate a 3 stars to show discontent (though also conceivably lower. But I think you'd argee that it seems anything less than 5 voices some dissatisfaction, whereas only a 1-2 star might do the same for a thoughtful reviewer.). The result is that, in a system where most use the binary, 'acceptable' value system, it becomes nearly impossible to separate the rating of thoughtful persons from the rating of discontented 'acceptable' value persons."
t3_2aymhj,cj0yroe,"It seems to me that, as far as mucking around with the genes of human beings goes, we ought to be prioritizing the development and refinement of such in vivo genetic modification over conventional eugenics and the creation of designer babies. For one, it provides an immediate benefit to the already living (whereas the other two techniques can only benefit the unborn), and for another, it allows for at least the initial beneficiary to give full, informed consent to the modification of their genome, and to select traits that they personally find desirable.

t3_2ah6lr,civ3ykt,"In SRS, if someone links to an obvious joke post, there will be no comments in the thread saying, ""That was clearly a joke"" because any such comments will be deleted and their posters may be banned. I've also seen a fair amount of people (and been one of those people) in TiA who say, ""Actually the post you linked has a really good point"" and get upvotes and good discussion, whereas this is explicitly against the mission of SRS. They just programmed automod to remind people and had a mod post about satire blogs recently."
t3_2afgwo,ciujkwd,"For example, Frantz Fanon's 1952 Black Skin, White Masks used the phrases 'woman of color' and 'man of color'. It's a positive term; whereas 'nonwhite' or 'minority' defines someone by what they are not, 'person of color' defines them by what they are. Further, it's use is meant to express solidarity:"
t3_29sw94,cioket0,"(Sidenote: might be worth reading up on URL as an example of an exceptional short player. Basketball is a team sport, whereas boxing is an individual competition. As such, a boxer is responsible for performing all aspects of the sport: defense, footwork, striking, etc."
t3_29sw94,cioket0,"Old school Nintendo's URL game demonstrated this reasonably well - you could have played all big guys against one another, but you'd miss out on numerous opportunities against teams that utilized the mid-sized and skinny guys. At the same time, the risks to personal injury are far greater with mismatched sizes in boxing (where injury is kind of the whole point), whereas those risks are substantially reduced in what should be a near-no-contact sport. (Sidenote: might be worth reading up on URL as an example of an exceptional short player."
t3_28xzqn,cig26mw,"Paternity leave and pay exists but in most cases it is not seen as equally fundamental or having equal weight (or leave, in fact). I'm not going to go into a distinction between female and male circumcision and to what extent they are different but plenty of people do see one as considerably worse and totally cruel whereas one is often seen as fairly normal practice. This, for a lot of people, is another gendered issue in which women need specific rights for women."
t3_25mebn,chile88,"Feminism is a cause which seeks to eliminate the Patriarchy, a system which unfairly and unequally gives men greater power and influence than women in some aspects of life, and reinforces expectations for the behaviour of both men and women according to their sex. For example, the expectation that a husband should earn more than his wife and should certainly be earning while his wife is, whereas it is socially acceptable for a woman to earn less than her husband or nothing at all. This expectation harms both men and women, because it puts pressure on men to earn more and thus work harder, it undermines womens careers particuularly in traditionally male fields, and it fails to take into account individual circumstances of families about what works best for them."
t3_23jmyp,cgxs8kb,"2) The Nazi leaders were wearing uniforms, and they were Nazi's so they were probably wearing elaborate, recognizable uniforms. Bin Laden was wearing daily clothing, it probably wasn't possible to see his face, and the SEAL members probably wouldn't have really recognized him anyway as I don't think we had seen pictures of him in years whereas Nazi higher ups were extremely public figures. It's very possible that the guy saw someone standing there, shot him, and later figured out it was Bin Laden."
t3_22rciz,cgq73lr,"I wouldn't phrase it that way, because people don't respond well to being told that they aren't allowed to do things, and I follow my own advice. But the diplomatic reality is that inter-group tensions rise when Group A says something potentially offensive about Group B, whereas when Group B says something potentially offensive about itself it is typically not so poorly received. That's what the sentiment ""you aren't allowed to say that, because of who you are"" captures, in this case."
t3_22p8vc,cgph660,"You're making a category error. The notion of a social construct addresses ideas, whereas I'm pretty sure in comparing it to biology you are thinking of it in terms of behaviors? They're not really the same thing."
t3_21w3iu,cgh6b84,"Emotions dictate what is important, and give us a sense of where and how to apply our reasoning. Emotion tells us where to go, whereas logic gets us there. Both are dead in the water on their own."
t3_21w3iu,cgh85yd,"Emotion has created art, which is (and here's where I throw the curveball) still vitally needed ; I don't think that one is more important than the other; if you are too coldly logical, you can stifle creativity, and if you are too emotional you can make too many stupid mistakes and hamstring your creative efforts. The relative importance of the two is dependent on what you're doing (logic, as presented above, is way more useful in finding solutions to tough problems when properly applied, whereas emotion is useful when dealing with humans who, as you said, aren't perfectly logical, and therefore require emotional sympathy to understand). Now into your comments: Firstly: ad hominem :) Secondly, and more seriously: if someone is accusing you of making a strawman and you think it unfounded, then either explain why it is not a strawman argument, or else get them to explain how you're misrepresenting that side of the argument."
t3_2055ga,cg00g0w,"This is actually very muddy water. For example, URL a very prominent economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, is a prominent Keynesian, and wrote: And yet, Mankiw was not convinced that the 2008-2009 stimulus was a good idea, whereas other prominent Keynesians like Paul Krugman actually warned that it was the right idea but smaller than it should have been. And Richard Posner, who is a famous jurist and also a prominent academic economist, URL in his book ""A Failure of Capitalism""."
t3_1z9nj1,cfrvhp5,"as for zipper's being noisy, you know they have silent zippers too? button's can't be airtight or water tight, whereas zippers can. thus making them the only real choice for space suits, dry diving suits, and hazmat suits."
t3_1xhrpt,cfbkr47,"Muhammad and the Caliphs (think like Emperors) that followed him built an empire. The key difference, however, is that Christianity was born through nonviolence, whereas Islam was born through war. Both went to war of course, but the Muslims admit it."
t3_1wxy0c,cf6nwss,"When there's a larger food supply, more aphids are born. You have caused an aphid's death, whereas it would never have died before your vegetarianism, because it would never have been born. If you have made a value judgement - one animal's life is more important than another animal's life, then you have lost the morality argument."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"This is why I think it occurs: 1. Men's chests aren't deemed to be sexual areas, that's why you guys can walk around with your tops off everywhere and it not be 'obscene' or 'public nudity' whereas women walking around with no clothes on top would be. You make the point below that it's your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"The situation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this - but in general women tend to touch men when they are flirting, whereas there's a pretty strong trend for men to just grab at women. There has not been a single club night in which me and my friends have not been grabbed, and often we can't even work out who did it."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"But in the past this hasn't been the case and we always take a while to shake off these double standards. So currently a girl grabbing a guy is seen as fun and flirty, and when he doesn't want it 'oops hahahah' whereas when guys grab a girl when she doesn't want there's an inherent perception of danger (if he's willing to do that when I didn't want it what else is he willing to do?) and in a world of averages the girl is in a situation where the guy fully has the ability to attack her/rape her with her having very little means to defend herself."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"4. as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it."
t3_1vd61r,cer3zby,"Perhaps it is a luxury for a trans* person to allievate their gender dysphoria. Poor trans* people may not be able to at all, depending on where they live, but they'll suffer for not having that 'luxury' whereas the cosplayers will not suffer. "
t3_1vd61r,cer51fm,"In that post, it's shown that it's not so much that transgender people deserve more sympathy than people with other dysphorias, but that the way to help GID is very different than the way to help the others. As in, GID's dysphoria can be cured by transitioning, whereas for others if they alter whatever they are fixating on, they will not be happy and will just find something else to despise. Edit: URL is that comment about the difference between GID and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and why they are treated differently, though both deserve sympathy."
t3_1us404,celnjcf,"Universal healthcare, free education, social care and strong welfare system can address these problems without the need for reformation of the system. To show this is working all we have to do is look back 100 years ago where one of the biggest health problems in the western world was malnutrition whereas now it is obesity. This is another big problem for communism; it doesn't take human nature into consideration."
t3_1ueayk,cehq9cv,"I hope to go back to grad school next year. The difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is that extrinsic motivations come from outside yourself -- they're a reward you're hoping to reach, or a punishment you're hoping to avoid -- whereas if you're intrinsically motivated to do something, you see it as rewarding in its own right, divorced from any benefits you receive from it. We are both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated to do all kinds of things in life."
t3_1tt75b,cebccgh,"Other sports don't necessarily have this level of perceptible momentum that readily is observed through the scoreboard. Football does have these swings in momentum, but it often takes a considerable amount of time to produce results on the scoreboard as the field is so large and scoring comes at a much slower clip as each PLAY is within 35 seconds whereas each SCORE in basketball is within 24 seconds. Many games are decided within 2 or 3 points; 2 or 3 baskets."
t3_1t3wf5,ce42cq8,"Using the grade-school definition of science really favors purely biological or chemical studies, as these are the easiest things to fit into the Scientific method - create a hypothesis, test it, etc... I feel like this places all of the emphasis on testing, whereas I think the research into existing knowledge is just as important when it comes to scientific studies. At its core, the goal of a ""science"" is to increase or refine knowledge through research."
t3_1suyq6,ce1jnf5,"Like anime/manga a decade or two ago in the West, fanfiction has become far more mainstream today. Vast sections of popular sites like TVTropes are devoted to fanfiction and far more people have at least been exposed to it, whereas even a decade ago mentioning you liked fanfiction entailed a long explanation of what it was (followed by people looking at you funny, wondering why you don't just read a book). Not so anymore."
t3_1rqcx7,cdpu3pe,"So the best we can hope for is to minimize the problem, since we can't eliminate it. Prohibition exacerbates the surrounding problems, whereas making it legal and cheap, while not solving the problem, would at least eliminate the black market and reduce how much addicts would need to steal to fund their habit. I never said it would be reduced in turnover - just amount of $ needed."
t3_1qw6q4,cdh4djd,"The difference plays out like this: a heteronormative couple act that way in public, then they get home, and how they engage with each other in terms of their gender roles is entirely different. ""Typical"" makes a statement about actual reality, whereas ""heteronormative"" more gets at cultural expectations for how people act (but don't necessarily describe how they actually act, or want to act, in private). "
t3_1qee3b,cdc0hlx,"Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't. The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally."
t3_1qdrzn,cdcifx6,"There is an overlap between the Humanities (The big four being history, philosophy, law and theology; but they all overlap and intertwine) and the Social Sciences. Both explore what is dramatically called the Human Experience, but whereas the Social Sciences study tangible, material experience, the Humanities tend to be more, for lack of a better word, ""transcendent"". The Humanities explore meaning, the Social Sciences explore social reality."
t3_1off27,ccroh74,"If the test needs to measure how quickly they can recall information or demonstrate a skill (as some tests need to do) then they do not get extended time on the test, because it would constitute a fundamental alteration. Studies have consistently shown that students without learning disabilities do not benefit from having more time to complete tests, whereas for students with disabilities, it can mean the difference between passing and failing. I have worked with several disabled undergraduates and grad students, some of whom were in very rigorous academic programs, who have gone on to be successful in their fields."
t3_1n5lqn,ccfq99c,"On the flip side, every time I go to a ""gun free zone,"" (like my college) I'm terrified because I know that the only ""good guys"" who are armed are the police, and it would take them several minutes just to run to the building where a shooter was last seen. A mass shooter could get 10 minutes of free roam because it takes the police so long to respond (and in a gunfight, a lot can happen in 10 minutes), whereas if we were allowed to carry, a shooter would get a minute at most before being shot by a citizen. I may not know the guy open carrying his pistol, but I know that chances are, he has it for protection."
t3_1mdwb3,cc8dkwo,"As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a >50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty. In Scot's law (IANAL but I'm pretty sure of this) there's an ""innocent"" verdict in addition to ""guilty"" and ""not guilty""- you might be able to argue that in situations in which an innocent verdict were returned the accuser should face trial, but even then you're going to discourage the reporting of abuse on the off-chance the abuser prepares for it and fabricates some kind of alibi"
t3_1lkxku,cc0nc73,"Take Rolls Royce, for example, verses Toyota Avalon. Rolls Royce: Handcrafted ""book matched"" wood with inlays
 Perfect full grain leather * Hand-welded aluminum body * Hand-built engine, signed by maker * Engine in an exotic configuration * Wool carpets * Perfect hand-sprayed and polished paint * Pin stripes and coach lines painted by hand by the only person in the world with a hand steady enough to do so * Extremely rigorous quality control * Completely customizable---and not just from a list, they will make anything you wish * Majority of parts made in England * Double-paned glass * Exclusivity * There is no little sticker that says (sic) the brand name; the ""Spirit of Ecstasy"" is made of sterling silver and retracts into the hood Toyota: Made on an assembly line
 Lower quality leather * Body unit the same as the Camry * Not hand welded, not made from aluminum * Engine mass made * Engine a V6 * Wood thin veneer * Lots of plastics * Mass-made * Lots of automation * Low QC and numerous flaws A significant number of Rolls Royces are still on the road (65%), whereas the same is not true for Toyotas. This kind of a luxury car is built to last a life-time, and this is why they hold their value so well, and part of why they cost so much."
t3_1lbmj6,cbya367,"How does Superman/Clark resolve his different halves, and should we see them as halves at all? - Kal is caught between his two fathers' views of his potential: Jor-El's all about what humanity can be, whereas Jonathan Kent's concerned about what humanity actually is. That there's such a difference between the two should be sobering, which is what makes Superman's faith in people, or rather his choice to have faith in people, all the more interesting."
t3_1khlm7,cbp0hy4,"Enter the electric motor - electric motors can deliver maximum torque from 0 RPM, which can be used to counterbalance the loss of power in an Atkinson cycle engine. The electric motor also has the benefit of being able to convert both electrical energy to kinetic energy, and vice versa - that is, it can be used to recover energy while braking, whereas conventional car braking setups cannot. This is another point in which hybrids beat conventional cars for efficiency."
t3_1j583o,cbba0li,"Dark Souls design is in part inspired by roguelikes, which also impart a sort deep tension and thrill from the high stakes permadeath. You may also consider that Dark Souls works under a different design philosophy than some other games, that they may seem childish because DS is all about challenge (and the beauty/experience of that), whereas other games will focus more about experience and interaction and just factor difficulty into that. Like for example, one of the most memorable moments in Fallout 3 is first exiting your tiny vault into the real world and your eyes have to adjust to the sunlight for the first time."
t3_1h6ah2,care65c,"There's a fundamental difference in philosophy here -- other languages, like Java an C#, do this kind of thing with elaborate tooling. I need Eclipse to add and organize my 'include' statements, whereas in Ruby, a system like Rails can even override const_missing to automagically load my classes when needed. I need Eclipse to generate setters/getters (and it's still awkward); in Ruby I can type ""attr_accessor""."
t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"One reason that I think your initial question is really useful and interesting is that calls our attention to the way religion and literature share massively overlapping projects: both seek to describe the way we distribute meaning throughout our lives by urging us to pay attention to certain features of the world. That religion does this is pretty clear (these behaviors are sins; these virtues), but literature does it, too: think of the way in which a Jane Austen novel teaches its heroines to view this person as marriageable and that person as not; or think of the way a Cold War spy thriller subtly suggests this kind of person (say, a bearded guy who has a habit of talking about the dangers of class is not to be trusted, whereas the Captain America looking corn-fed fellow is al right!). Religion, especially medieval Christianity used to have a lock on this shit (""No God but ME!"
t3_1fl5d8,cabci41,"URL is wikipedia's list of Christians alone, completely disregarding the classical and Arabic contribution to the scientific canon. The only way out of this bind is to redefine the word 'scientist' to suit your preferred definition; ""The man who discovered genetics (Gregor Mendel) was not a true scientist because he only discovered genetics through rigorous experimentation and application of the scientific method, whereas to be a true scientist one must also fulfill some other arbitrary criteria"" (in this case; ""be an atheist""). This is simply a 'no true Scotsman' fallacy - it is not part of the definition of 'scientist' that you have a certain cluster of beliefs, only that you are (or were) engaged in the practice of science."
t3_1f93x1,ca88twm,"We, as macroscopic objects are in capable of directly experiencing this effect. We are only 4D objects, whereas particles are much smaller, and experience the effects of the higher dimensions. This carries some interesting philosophical implications."
t3_1f14ip,ca69sod,"I'm not bad at math. My professors agree with this, and when I've taken alternate kinds of testing (like an oral exam in a professor's office where I do the test on a chalkboard in front of the professor) I have yet to get less than an A, whereas my on-paper tests usually range around a B- or C. Even when I don't use the extra time, it's a bit of padding that keeps my anxiety down, which allows me to do better. Average test grade before I was granted extra time - low C to high D. So you see the difference here."
t3_1cdk1m,c9fscps,"Do you know why? Because I can talk to women like we're both people, whereas men try to talk to me like they think we're going to sleep together. Girls are a lot more to be flighty and silly when talking to a guy than they are when talking to another girl."
t3_1bjd8m,c97bsim,"How does it benefit the shareholders to devote an inefficient amount of time (and therefore money) to interviewing a very large number of applicants when an approximate quality can be sourced far more cheaply? Also, shareholders retain their vote and influence in the form of essential funds and callable bonds, whereas voters whose choices are Corrupt Guy A and Corrupt Guy B have effectively lost their power over the process. I don't value equality as much in business as much as I do in politics."
t3_1are2i,c902a8w,"The punishment for copyright infringement is drastically higher than that of theft. Stealing a physical CD is considered a petty crime with very minor punishment, whereas downloading a CD's worth of songs can be ten to fifteen counts of a charge with four digit penalties. A lawsuit over that much piracy can easily result in settlements of thousands of dollars rather than tens of thousands of dollars."
t3_18dj9h,c8f0c1f,"It's a weak argument. So to summarize, your response isn't really a solid basis of retort on a topic that's firstly, quite subjective, and secondly, one where you speak from a place of having not tried the opposing lifestyle first hand for any given length of time - whereas I have. Maybe you too would feel better if you included some meat in your lifestyle - you have no idea if this is true or not :) I don't care if you find that out, but maybe, just maybe, you could step down from the extreme position that every other reason for eating meat is invalid?"
t3_33ntp6,cqmtgl3,"The bigger argument is that society, beyond the individual, is racist, and the individual action is simply a manifestation of societal racism (e.g. a white person is ignorant about a Native American headdress because they were never taught about its significance, whereas Native American people would know not to make a fashion statement out of a crucifix because of the dominance of white culture) I agree that endless thinkpieces about the possibly-racist event of the week are annoying, but I don't think they detract from real discussions about race. These articles may be someone's first exposure to talking about race."

t3_332jn0,cqgxjbr,"In the transplant problem, killing the innocent man is normally seen as a violation of the first principle. Killing the man to take his organs also violates the second point, since his death is both intended and necessary to achieve the goals, whereas in the trolley problem when you throw the switch, the only intent is to save the five, not to kill the one. Again, utilitarians like yourself and other consequentialist ethicists probably will not agree that things like ""intentions"" matter at all, but I hope you can at least see there are some legitimately recognized philosophical distinctions between the trolley problem and the transplant problem, not just psychological ones."

People in situation -2-, on the other hand, need to ask hard questions: why is it that Country A, your native country whose culture is familiar and comfortable, is so shitty that you left behind everything to start over somewhere else, whereas Country B, the new country whose culture seems unfamiliar and ugly, is so amazing that you chose to live here rather than your native land? In some cases the shittiness of Country A relates to economics."

The problem is that information-generation skills generally don't stack up, combine with each other, or provide foundations for the generation of more advanced skills, whereas skills based on personal knowledge do. Search engines aren't magical."

t3_2ucr50,co7790p,"I don't understand where the line is you're drawing with fashion. You can casually glance at a watch during a meeting or conversation, whereas pulling out the cell phone to check the time is distracting and rude. They're not entirely the same."
