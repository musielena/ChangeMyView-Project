t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"Sure, with knowledge of basic numbers, we could theoretically use those numbers to derive all the theorems of geometry and calculus, reinvent fields like engineering, and create whole new mathematical principles simply by thinking about them, because math is a completely human invention. However, this is obviously foolish because countless geniuses have already made those discoveries; it makes much more sense to learn about what's already been discovered, even if (and especially if) you hope to make new discoveries yourself. And to assume that a person who knows very little about math could come up with those theories is, while strictly theoretically true, practically ridiculous."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible. At the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject."

t3_2r6a86,cncxj5i,"Why? because it is casual all you need is the blue turtle or the rocket and you win, even if you suck at it. The main thing that separates competitive from normal or pubs is the fact they make make the game more balanced and develop a meta."
t3_2r07cv,cnblh5h,"Birth defects are as much a part of God's plan for our lives as, for better or worse, how good our parents are at developing us. There is nothing wrong with you, even if you aren't made the same as everyone else. You are no less perfect as a person no matter what birth ""defect"" you have."

t3_2qncj3,cn7wgim,"From what I've seen for the military system, it's like 50% (and it's going to be worse for specialties the military does not need all that many of). You're taking a huge gamble here, even if you're a great candidate for neurosurgery, you probably won't actually become one because not many are needed, at least not via the military route. Second, compounding that gamble, is the fact that you might not be a great candidate for neurosurgery."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3ddwl,"That means that, no matter how shitty they may be as people, they are very, very unlikely to turn their predatory gaze on you. They don't want what you have, and even if they did you would not be tempted by what they offer. Only women are compatible with you in the violent-emotional-relationship game."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3ddwl,"So, given that you don't have any of the necessary moving parts to engage in an emotionally violent relationship with these people, you instead have a more stable, mutually understanding one. This is important: even if they are exactly as shitty as the women in your life . They aren't shitty to you, and you hear about their relationships from them."
t3_2p3d0h,cmszanf,"1) Those two had a certain relationship; the non-""victim"" forcibly took that relationship into a new realm without asking your friend about how he felt about that. 2) Depending on which half (top or bottom) was naked, there's going to be a stronger or weaker sexual aspect of the situation, even if no actual sex was going on. Hell, some fake sexuality could have been introduced if either one of them woke up with a morning erection, especially if it was touching the other person."
t3_2ouj9f,cmqrfg1,"High school is merely trying to turn you into a well-rounded person who is prepared for the next step of learning / job readiness. The objective of High School is to teach you how to learn and to give you a very broad exposure, and fine arts do a lot of that - even if the subject doesn't appeal to you personally. Consider: Quantitative problem solving is great and all, but clear communication and persuasive writing &amp; speaking are absolutely critical life skills."
t3_2orvv0,cmq18ik,I agree with a sense of moral relativism if consent and the capacity for consent is presupposed. It's not immoral for adults to have casual sex even if in another culture it's considered wrong. It's not immoral for someone to drink alcohol even if another culture thinks it's wrong.
t3_2orvv0,cmq18ik,"It's not immoral for adults to have casual sex even if in another culture it's considered wrong. It's not immoral for someone to drink alcohol even if another culture thinks it's wrong. These are activities that consenting adults take part in, there is nothing immoral about these acts, and differences of opinion are just cultural attitudes on what is and isn't considered polite or acceptable behaviour."
t3_2o66aa,cmkb48q,"I wouldn't say I find her attractive overall (mostly because of facial structure, sour expression, and overuse of makeup), but there's definitely more to like there than her hair. 2) The context of this kind of ""question"" (even if phrased as a statement) is one of the person looking for reassurance, not one of a person being honest with themselves about being unattractive. If all they wanted to do is the latter, they would have just made a judgement about themselves and shut up about it."
t3_2o2kga,cmj4j7t,"As you say, there is no clear ending to the song and we therefore cannot claim with certainty what happened. But I do not think that it was rape/sexual assault even if they did sleep together. At least not the man raping the woman."
t3_2o2kga,cmj4j7t,"It is unclear if the comment about the contents of the drink were supposed to be funny, or a reference to something sinister. Bottom line is that even if there was an issue of consent being given while intoxicated, that consent issue applies to both the man and the woman. If she cant giver her consent due to being drunk, neither can he."
t3_2nurqb,cmh25d1,"I don't really have an answer, but, in the context of the ongoing debate on consent and college rape, I must point out: if we are going to call the second scenario rape, then we have to agree that Shia Lebeouf was as well. All that said, even if we agree that the standard of ""affirmative consent"" isn't practical, I think there is a strong argument, which I see others have already made, that he didn't give any consent for any sexual activity, which would still make it rape. "
t3_2nthvd,cmgq9aq,"Most colleges consider their role to be more than simply producing good employees - they are trying to create well-balanced citizens. History classes help provide a more well-rounded education that allows you to have a clearer view of the world, even if it doesn't make you more attractive to employers. But if that was our only goal, then everyone would only take classes in their major (and whatever cross-disciplinary ones were absolutely necessary) and an internship to graduate."
t3_2mqujn,cm6wgd3,"Why can't you have both? It is far too easy to overlook the impact of the choices we make when the results aren't immediately apparent, but just know that even if the statistics of world poverty don't change, people do. You can't expect to free millions of people just by choosing what you buy, but even if your choices change one person's life for the better, this is a tremendous impact."

t3_2ljn6y,clw2dux,"While I agree there are better and worse regulations, OP was looking for even a single example. The EPA can boast about some gains in efficiency even if they also have some failures to answer for. "
t3_2ljn6y,clwzg0l,"OP asked for a single example. If I can chop wood more efficiently than you can, even if you carry water much more efficiently, that's all that's needed to satisfy those conditions. Also, my point about efficiency took into account the cost, that's the meaning of efficiency."
t3_2lclza,cltkxlu,"A lot of the time those chickens are treated worse than regular chicken because there is less supervision http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/free-range-organic-meat-myth/ . So even if let's say 30 percent of the people coming to a burger restaurant ordered a burger that came from an ethically treated animal it doesn't mean that the animal was actually treated better than a normal one. If however you (and a whole bunch of other people) decided to only order a vegetarian meal then you can know for sure that no animals were killed in the making of your food As for ""Second, an individual not eating meat makes zero difference, almost."""
t3_2l6x4s,cls5cf8,"It is merely that some goods are sustainable and others not. It is clearly preferable to have 10 years of quality living than to have 10 years of miserable living, even if death inevitably looms. It is mistaken to think that because something is only good now, that it isn't good because it is temporary."
t3_2k6r90,clih4bd,not everyone leaves or stop working) is mostly cultural - Swedes are raised to have pride in their profession. They would even pay to have a job even if there was less money in it than being on the dole. This is why Swedes that migrated to USA show a similar work ethic and happiness score to those who stayed in Sweden.

t3_2k3k0f,clhsvqc,"Even in my own work as an EMT, I am treated differently as a women. These attitudes are still harmful, even if we have won the same legal rights as men (although paid maternity/paternity leave for both genders would be beneficial for all). Even the NAACP is still continuing to combat cultural attitudes towards black people, long after they won their legal battles."

Another example, it is still illegal for you to hire prostitutes abroad, even if the country has legalized prostitution. If they find out about it back home and deem it worthy to prosecute you is another matter entirely."
t3_2jaz9o,cla6j13,"Not only that without the unintentional or intentional deflection, there is no way to discern whether the original shot would have gone in if it wasn't for the man responsible for it deflecting off them. Furthermore, even if you believe it was complete luck that it was deflected off a player, that player is still in the right spot at the right time, so give credit where credit is due. "
t3_2j7ldo,cl93ul2,"I've always found it easy to be optimistic about other people when I feel good about what I'm doing. Depending on where you volunteer you will serve people, and I think it's never easier to love people than when you're trying to serve them, even if they're kind of jerks. I got punched in the face outside a soup kitchen once and I still feel positively about all my time there."
t3_2j7gwy,cl9fm82,"So if I have any view, I'm curious about the arguments against it or orthogonal to it, because there are always other perspectives. So even if my ""view"" isn't completely flipped, the process of engaging with other viewpoints and considerations is worthwhile because you learn a lot in the process and you have to refine and reconsider your own arguments. So my mind is always ""changed"" in some way or another, even if it's just a matter of learning interesting things from other people."

Second, I assume I'm always wrong about something in ways I probably haven't considered yet."
t3_2j7gwy,cl9fm82,"Finally, I think because there are always more than two sides to an issue, the discussion/debate itself is valuable because everyone gets to see for themselves why people see things in various ways, and what considerations go into why they hold certain views. So even if the OP doesn't necessarily say, OK I was completely wrong and now I think the complete opposite of what I thought before, the learning/insight that everyone gets from seeing into other people's minds/thinking on various issues is often fun and valuable anyway. It's not all about the delta's, in other words."
t3_2j4itf,cla9i9a,"Someone can violate your ""right to life"", Society sets out protect your ""right to life"" by punishing murder, manslaughter, etc. This seems a more practical way to look at rights, especially since the nation or society is what promotes and protects rights, even if you feel ""god granted you those rights"". God only protects rights through after-life threats and rewards."
t3_2izt1m,cl75zb3,"Many of the leaders of ISIS are former Baathist generals from the Iraqi army which the Americans dissolved early in the occupation. So not only did previous U.S. intervention lead directly to the creation of ISIS, it's likely a problem that we would have had to confront even if we had maintained a more ""interventionist"" approach. Taking a step back from this specific situation, I think the Ron Paul position properly understood is not that it will all be one big love fest once we withdraw, but precisely that we should allow for a certain degree of chaos and instability in the world."
t3_2iu5ia,cl5ixzd,"Basically, your issue stems from the fact that political philosophy has developed into a wide and diverse academic field over the last several hundred years. Some reading topics I would recommend for you, so you can understand the viewpoints of others better, even if only to know thy enemy, would be (all wiki links, but feel free to go deeper): [Negative and positive rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)

t3_2ir1vh,cl4rrcl,"Both think that they advocate for equal rights for all, but in general, both think the other movement is flawed and operating off incorrect premises. I made the point earlier that even if MRA and feminism share the goal of egalitarianism, they differ starkly on how close we are to it currently and how to get there. But that's a different dispute than ""are they truly egalitarian?""."
t3_2hpa2d,ckuzhiu,"For this reason alone, the iPhone 6 is actually the worst smartphone on the market, from a purely hardware perspective. To put it another way: even if the Ford Pinto was a super-fast racing machine (it wasn't), it would still be the worst car ever because it had a propensity to explode when rear-ended, something that a car should very much not do. There are certain things that just take away from any good points that a thing might have, and those are typically basic structural engineering and basic functionality tests."
t3_2gzzdj,cko704v,"For example the concept of ""karma"" or afterlife or the lack of afterlife or the concept of one god or no god. But obviously these concepts cannot be tested and I don't see how physics can ever answer them even if they do come up with a ""unified theory"" of how things work.

t3_2gliyk,ckkhubk,"And I can't think of a bigger economic and social nightmare than a bankrupt, half-built nuclear power plant. Oh, and even if the plant DOES get built, the fuel isn't gonna be that much cheaper. Think of all the engineers and technicians you have to pay to keep the plant running safely."
t3_2ggq4d,ckiyjmb,"How did the preorder help that situation? But frankly, preordering the next major mega-studio title doesn't come with the same risk and it ensures that you get the game even if it sells out (which it won't since its a major title), and possibly unlocks some DLC you wouldn't have otherwise gotten (which is typically pointless cruft anyway). I am not sure why your friend would have freaked out."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"That's partially what I was going for, because I got the impression you felt no sympathy for men in these situations. My goal is to have you consider that there may be circumstances, even if they are rare, that should impact the financial outcomes. In my eyes, children are the biggest factor because the larger portion of the money should go toward providing a stable life for them."
t3_2fgw85,ck9ihil,"I think the answer is yes. I think we owe it to our loved ones to save them from the fate I described above, even if it is painful. Their happiness, and avoidance of their pain, simply is a reason for you to continue living."
t3_2eqf4w,ck22nty,"If you're familiar with scientific studies most want sample sizes at least ten times that number, often more. In addition to that, even if you use no noxious stimuli at all during an experiment, everything is highly regulated and controlled. You literally have to have the number of hours of light vs dark approved, ideal temperatures have to be maintained, bedding has to be clean, water replaced daily, etc."
t3_2e2rb6,cjvzfop,"I'm also guessing you haven't gone out of your way to murder someone else or inflict pain on anybody innocent. I think actions like this reveal that one already finds meaning and value in life, even if they can't articulate just what that meaning really is. "
t3_2e1fah,cjwh2ek,"$580/mo, even when taking into consideration the initial purchase price of the vehicle, seems steep to me. Plus even if you were saving $300/mo or so on transportation, it still doesn't compensate for the increase in the cost of housing. In my city you're going to pay about 25% more/mo for about 1/3 of the amount of space than what you'll get for the same price in the county."
t3_2e1fah,cjwh2ek,"Taxes, groceries, and utilities are also more expensive in my city than in my county. Again, it may be different where you live, but where I'm from the city is still more expensive, even if you manage to save on transportation costs. "
t3_2dtng7,cjt058f,"Scientist have been looking into quantum effects as a counter argument, but the majority agree that it is very unlikely to have any effect on decision-making. And even if it did, randomness doesn't really help Free will. So yes, ""real"" free will is an illusion."
t3_2dqcyj,cjs2c78,"This isn't to say that you're view is wrong per se, it just seems to me to be woefully incomplete. I'm very skeptical that businesses are going to work together on this sort of thing, and even if they did, would that kind of collusion even be legal? I don't know!"
t3_2djvzv,cjq7mxo,"Probably not, you would have been watching cartoons anyway. And even if you did, no reason to think you would remember them. Basically, you would have the same memory as now, minus the Sears commercial."
t3_2dhno3,cjpktss,"How do you feel about that? Second, even if a person mistakenly votes against their own interest, why do they deserve to be punished? It is a firm conviction of mine that nobody deserves unhappiness, and a person should only ever be harmed if doing so serves some larger cause."
t3_2dfees,cjozx4o,"Me not eating meat might make a minuscule difference, but when it comes to my personal meat consumption, even reducing the amount of meat I eat by 50% is a great difference. total vegetarians reduce their meat consumption by 100% so their personal contribution is huge, even if they still eat dairy and eggs. "
t3_2cm5jd,cjguy6j,"Civilization may in fact fall apart, thought I doubt it as nothing that exciting ever happens in real life. But even if it does, it won't be because democracy has failed us because we're all to stupid. Since we have that broad range of possible outcomes between utopia and Beyond the Thunderdome it isn't really needed for each individual citizen to know beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute best course for our countries to take."

But even if it worked like you say it would, and wages evened out after a period of readjustment, it's still detrimental to waiters.

t3_2chdyb,cjfio2z,"Since I enjoy and appreciate both, it's clearly not a taste issue. I would never choose to eat hot pizza for breakfast, even if it were fresh, so it's not an issue of being lazy. It's just not a breakfast food to me."
t3_2ch2je,cjff0g8,"People still play them and have fun. Overall, Red and Blue were two of the best games I've ever played, and I think that even if people found the grinding and battle strategy a bit annoying sometimes, the rest of the game more than made up for it. "
t3_2byn8t,cjb5z3f,"I think the objective wrongness of such laws absolutely is relevant, because it gives western governments grounds to criticize African anti-gay laws.

t3_2bev6f,cj4o0am,Even on a coffee break or lunch period. I think it's extremely appropriate to label these as NSFW even if it's simply text. It gives me the opportunity to decide whether I want to read it or not.

t3_2av5cs,ciz8cfe,"They're dirty, they're in torn up clothes, most are on something, almost all of them have obvious mental health issues. If I was running a business, even one that only pays minimum wage, I would still not consider hiring any of them, even if they begged me for the job.

t3_299gqu,cjbtws1,"In fact, one could make a pretty good argument that carbon pollution is the least significant form of pollution from a fossil fuel energy source, even without being a global warming denier, since we're probably past the point of no return for GW anyway. And even if we're not there yet it'd be virtually impossible to summon the political will to stop us from reaching it. So it's very hard to compare one form of fossil fuel to another in terms of environmental harm, since each has its own forms of pollution and ""collateral damage"" from extraction and processing, and my imprecise statement reflects that."

The only reason this video is on the front page is because men feel truly oppressed by what they perceive to be a double standard that says they can't hit women even if they're being attacked. I may be wrong but I'm fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"Now we may simply not have the full context of the situation and our assessment may be wrong but that would have more to do with lack of doing research on the video than our views of the video itself. I agree it's a bit silly when we cheer people on for violence, even if it is self defense, for giving us that cathartic self righteous feeling but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with gender roles. It seems to me however that you think this is ridiculous because you may still be attached to the perception that for some reason women are weaker or more fragile than men, which is a sexist assumption to make."

While it may be a valid solution in the real world, having the characters simply decide to enter a polyamorous relationship might seem like a cop-out to said fiction-consumers, or they'll scoff at it for being naive, even if it is equally naive to resolve the love triangle a more typical way.

t3_2ylbub,cpan2i7,"1/10^7 x 0.01 x $10^13 = $10,000 So your vote has an expected value of $10,000 benefit to the nation. Your vote is still worth something, even if both parties are crap. I see you're a libertarian."
t3_2y1qef,cp5h19u,"Oncologists literally wouldn't have careers if there wasn't such a thing as cancer, but I'm not convinced that they're making it up. The arguments against mandatory childhood vaccination can come from valid opinions that the government shouldn't force medical treatment onto someone who doesn't want it, even if it's for the good of society, but that's a subjective argument that just comes down to how you feel about the issue. Regarding the science, though, the evidence is crystal-clear."
t3_2xlisq,cp1754z,"You make mistakes, too. If you want your friends to be there for you when you're in trouble, even if they think you have made bad decisions to get yourself into that trouble, then you should do the same for them. Lastly, and this is the most important thing, the consequences of them being alone when they get too drunk are far worse than they deserve, or than you would wish upon them."
t3_2x53ga,cowym99,"What if they have children that similarly don't assimilate according to your values? What happens if someone is only living in the UK temporarily for work (even if ""temporarily"" means more than 1 year?) Are they expected to assimilate?"
t3_2wzy6i,covpeqv,"I think I understand where you're coming from. The idea being that less people would shop at a store if it said ""no blacks, Arabs or jews"" even if they were white or Asian. The problem is this goes beyond goods and services."
t3_2wt9ya,cotx5b0,"In a culture or time when this is an acceptable practice (and yes some have existed), if morality is completely relative, then there is nothing wrong with raping babies. Heck, if there is no objective morality, then there is nothing wrong with raping babies even if your culture says that there is something wrong with it. But you resist that, because you and I both know that raping babies is wrong, and it's wrong in any time or place, even one where the people don't agree with you."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"But, yes, immoral actions are immoral whether or not you know they are immoral. (Just as a person who tells you the sun orbits the earth is wrong, even if they believe they are right, even if they were raised in a time and place where everyone believed that.) The law is not an attempt to create objective morality."
t3_2vxd18,colrkuv,"Someone like a janitor might provide something of more use to society(that's up for debate though), but they provide to a very limited number of people. so even if they just provide ""a few hours' worth of good television"", they still provide it to hundreds of millions of people. I would say they do more than that though take how people feel when watch their nation play in the world cup, that inspires people and brings people together."
t3_2vks7u,coim6rj,"If you wanted to heighten your chances of getting into the school of your choice you could have joined a team too. How is it unfair, or how are standards uneven if it's an option open to everyone? Why should we be restricting where athletes can or should apply to college because you wanted a better shot at getting into the school of your choice?"
t3_2v7lcq,cof892z,"This is a pretty poor example. Furthermore, even if it wasn't intrinsically racist, I can't think of a scenario where the benefits of Blackface would outweigh the detriments of offending a large group of people. As stated above, Blackface is not necessary to any celebratory reasons, so the only use I see for it is amusement (for Halloween or whatever)."

t3_2v4vs4,coenx4c,"I'll start with monetary gains from the wars as that's the slightly easier one to tackle. I would personally agree with you that wars were not really about oil or natural resources, but even if there you were to argue that there were gains made there, the main monetary gain from the US were the government contractors. Its the companies that had contracts to produces military goods and who had other government contracts to supply the military or build projects in these countries that really made out."
t3_2ujfms,co951h9,"Wikipedia is by far the largest wiki in the world. But it is not the first wiki, and it is not the defining wiki in fact, even if it is the main (or only) one people know of. If you have any use for a mass-editable website, whether an encyclopedia or anything else, a wiki may be a good tool for it."
t3_2u6r1a,co5no9a,"Deliberately voting blank can be seen as protest. I just looked it up and invalid/blank votes in Denmark are actually recorded, so you really are declaring ""None of the Above"", even if it doesn't count in the overall result. In my extreme example of ""Hitler vs. Satan"", a blank vote is obviously the best option, since it is the only way you are not supporting or complying with two undesirable candidates"
t3_2tekkp,cnzrdgm,"So its logical that terrorists go after the people suppoting the US military. Right, because it was OBAMA the one that started the whole iraq and afghanistan clusterfucks, no way BUSH had anything to do with those... Now you are just inventing stuff, Both Truman and Roosevelt during ww2 are responsible for way more dead foreigners than Obama, even if they arguably had better reasons for it. I believe we are all accomplices of our government's actions because we suppor that very same government with our taxes."
t3_2t6ote,cnwdiha,Yet we should recognize we are wading in waters of extreme human emotion and I really don't think how we label people is going to make any bit of difference. Someone registers as a threat to a parent keeping their child (even if they are just a witness - as is the person who made the original report in this case) and you trigger some deep down protective lion in the hearts of people that is absolutely blind to these distinctions. Edit: and this article says 700 kids a year are seized from their parents by child protective services and police without warning while the judicial process plays out (and 2/3rds are found not to have been abused in any way).
t3_2rq5g3,cnih5d9,"Infinity and probability are strange things, and perhaps this insanely unlikely outcome occurs for every person who makes it into heaven; it could theoretically happen, and there would be no issue with ""free will"" being violated here. ""6"" is certainly not true even if the only condition needed for sin to occur is the individual ability to choose; it's just very likely to be the case. With that said, I would suggest it's entirely possible to have ""free will"" and yet be incapable of choosing to sin."
