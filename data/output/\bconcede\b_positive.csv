t3_2p82u7,cmudm5u,"This act does not reflect your moral character. I might even concede that an action is morally insignificant if it was not guided by a moral belief. However, you are arguing not only that moral acts must be guided by moral beliefs; you are arguing that moral acts must be guided by moral beliefs and that those beliefs must have been diligently reasoned upon."
t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"After revisiting the books later though to see why I had (briefly) originally liked them, I decided a lot of their appeal was because they deconstructed a lot of the tropes that they're made of. I'll concede that TFiOS is really overrated, but I think Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns in particular are really solid because they're a twist on the Manic Pixie Dream Girl thing that's really prolific in media right now. I think it's really important to see books that show the female romantic lead to the introverted male protagonist as a flawed human and not just a collection of traits that change the life of the protagonist."
t3_2f48co,ck5tk52,"How can we say that this is an intentional effort to make people stupid, and not just a recognition that this stuff sells very well? Of course, I don't concede that any of the fiction you are attacking is particularly bad for you. Imaginative play is pretty clearly very important in the development of intelligence in young children."
t3_2eqf4w,ck2r887,I think its important to focus in on the leaving the dog at home example. If you are willing to concede that a good life for a person is a drastically different thing than a good life for an animal I think we are making important progress. I believe you would also concede that dogs are relatively high functioning among animals.
t3_2eqf4w,ck2r887,"If you are willing to concede that a good life for a person is a drastically different thing than a good life for an animal I think we are making important progress. I believe you would also concede that dogs are relatively high functioning among animals. They are more curious, playful, emotional, and social than cows or pigs."
t3_2brzwb,cj8hzbv,"To construct a mental model of the world and then claim there is no room/need for consciousness is like building a table, then kicking all the legs away. If consciousness is an artifact or side-effect of complexity, then you must concede that computers, now or at some later stage, will acquire consciousness, over and above AI or neural nets, where we simply code them to emulate human behavior. An alternate view of consciousness is that the brain is a receiver of consciousness, in the same way that a TV receives signals."
t3_2274kr,cgk4b3c,"The remaining passages that may deal with homosexuality were written by apostles well after Jesus' death. To follow me past this point, you'll have to concede that the Bible is not the verbatim word of God. It was written by flawed humans living in and writing to address specific contexts."
t3_1yhd8w,cfkunw0,"You can maybe wiggle out of this if the buyer is extremely honest and self-aware, but in general, I'm really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they'd make if piracy wasn't on the table. But I'll concede that if you have a really large bold IF qualifying your claim, maybe there's no financial impact. Morality - But like I said, that's not really the angle I'd use to argue that piracy is immoral."
t3_1xtu9a,cfelt93,"I need to know that I don't have a minute to spare - this allows me to immerse myself in what I'm doing and give it my undivided attention. There have been times when I have not procrastinated on projects, and I will concede that I was more relaxed as I was getting them done. But I am absolutely sure I took more time on those projects than was necessary, and I do not believe I produced a better finished product."
t3_1x5wrj,cf8fe6i,"I would like to propose that you do not need to change your fundamental belief in order to sustain your friendships: you have other options, the most healthy of which is to cultivate friendships where you can enjoy debating and discussing differences of opinion. And OK, I concede that this may not be the most ''easy'' option in the short term, but the long term rewards are so great that your friendships will be easier and closer and more fulfilling as you grow older, when you feel you can express your views and disagree while maintaining care and respect for each other. You don't have to sell your soul to make friends, you can be true to yourself and make even greater friends."
t3_1t8yrt,ce5k8r6,"Is it immoral? Suppose I concede that pirates reduce the studios' profitability, and that increased profitability would attract more studios and thereby lower prices/increase supply of movies. I think you need another step to show that it is nevertheless immoral to pirate."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"While I don't know that I would go so far as to say it would be impossible for a non-empathetic person to hold this value system, it does seem intuitively contradictory, or at least incongruous. And even if I concede the point that a non-empathetic person might sincerely measure his/her success as an individual on these merits, his/her lack of empathy will not give him/her an advantage in achieving success over a sincerely empathetic individual. Furthermore, if a person measures his/her success on a combination of values rather than just one (which seems more realistic), if one of those values is authenticity or integrity along with some form of altruism, then I think a lack of empathy would be more of a hindrance than an aid."
t3_1gxf5p,caorflp,"Chances are, I wouldn't have gotten in to the series at all were it not for that moment. I'm willing to concede that spoiling a series isn't the worst possible thing, but can you agree that if you spoil an ending or crucial plot detail you are reducing someone's future enjoyment of that work? "
t3_1f9bqn,ca85ryy,"Stun-guns are hard to use, and totally ineffective at range. I will concede, however, that for short range combat (under 10 feet), a knife would potentially be a better weapon to have than a gun. "
t3_1dgj00,c9q3kq9,"The problem is similar to that of the death penalty. Many people (myself included) would not have reservations about executing certain criminals, but concede that the death penalty should not be instituted in today's society. We simply don't have the resources to ensure that the people we're killing are guilty."
t3_1cyk99,c9l9oja,"The second advantage of this approach is that it is very easy to see what didn't work when you are telling a robot to drive in a square. I will concede that this will most likely only teach functional programming, but having these foundations down will help anyone tackle the next challenge. For this reason I say that Python would be an excellent second language to learn."
t3_32w62j,cqf8h6r,"The best musicians find incredibly technically difficult and creative ways to create the same sounds. So while I do agree that individuals must concede degrees of their own creativity and expression to form a whole, I would disagree with the assertion that there is no creativity or expressiveness at all. "
t3_30rc1i,cpv526i,"Isn't it possible, indeed more likely, that they are just having a difference experience than you? I am the first to concede that I do not understand the trans position at all. I do not get it."
t3_2zpo9g,cplrjw9,Because neither party is willing to submit or give an inch when they literally may be inches away from gaining/losing a branch of our federal government. To compromise is to concede certain points. Conceding certain points can be a concession of power.
t3_2zpo9g,cplrjw9,"People talk about when Reagan and Tip O'Neill compromised in the 80's. This is because they each had to: the Republicans had no shot at the House so to get anything done they had to concede and Democrats had no shot at the White House so to get anything done they had to concede. So you can ""Shake things up"" if you want but until something changes with the above-mentioned issues, the gridlock will remain."
