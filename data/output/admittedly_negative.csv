t3_2j7xhu,cl96t4g,"For example, greatapes subreddit is dedicated to hating ethnic minorities. Secondly, while I'm admittedly not an expert, there does seem to be a connotation of hate speech being directed at a member of a protected class - which I'm pretty sure that television show preference is not. "
t3_2i6sq2,ckzpzfm,"I disagree that singling out feminists isn't warranted though. In the case what we're talking about here is a large, international effort to inject feminist ideology into Wikipedia at large, which is in fact a direct threat to it's objectivity, and in some cases reliability due to articles being removed (Thomas James Ball comes to mind, which admittedly predates this academia infiltration). More importantly, this was not the actions of a few isolated radical feminists, but was instead a large-scale effort by academic feminists on an international scale, including the gender studies departments at multiple Ivy League universitites in the US."
t3_2e3t22,cjwos6i,"Where did you get that from? I admittedly provided a extreme, simplistic example to showcase my point, but don't tell me that if the top 1% of the population legally controlled 40% of the government we wouldn't start seeing some policies that favored large corporations at the expense of others. Hell, we see that today with current lobbying practices."

t3_273kmd,chxabgz,"You have taken the possibility out of the scenario yourself by never wanting to try and never have had tried alcohol, so even if you were presented with positives you yourself could not even have enough information to make a decision that would affect everyone else in your country or the world with a straight face, if you treat alcohol like, say, meth. You have also ruled out the possibility for other ways to solve the (admittedly) bad side affects of alcohol when consumed in excess or used irresponsibly (such as before getting into a car, going to work under the influence, etc). Raising the legal limit, requiring stricter rules for getting a liquor/beer license, limiting the places someone could drink legally, raising the penalties for abusing alcohol, increased awareness through educational campaigns, etc have not even been considered, let alone thought through completely before simply thrown out with the bathwater by placing it on the same level, as say meth."
t3_1qran5,cdfnvr7,"It's a legal as well as an emotional contract. It's about sharing love and ensuring monogamy, which admittedly does often lead to children but they are not the reason that marriage exists. 3- Because same sex couples cant have children, you feel that there's no reason for them to marry."
t3_1mq464,ccbrs5p,"Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word ""racist""? It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away. Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said ""this is what I'm talking about right here, guys"" without explaining why it's racist."
t3_1lt0gt,cc2gt9x,"First of all, the notion of a ""two party system"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If 80% of the popular vote in every state had gone to Jill Stein, she would have become president, unless for some grand unprecedented fixing at the Congressional level (which admittedly could probably happen). Secondly, how do you even know that McCain and Romney would really be as bad as you feared?"
t3_1hw3be,caykf0u,"It's not that correct spelling and grammar have intrinsic value, it's that they suggest the writer is educated and well read. People on the internet don't know you; they don't know if you're actually an expert in whatever you're talking about or if you're some regular schmo off the streets, so they have to look to other, sometimes admittedly superficial indicators of your credibility. Inasmuch as creating the impression of credibility is important for someone making an argument, then expressing that argument with correct spelling and grammar is important."
t3_1d44p3,c9mrjf5,"I know a total of 6 people who have been/are on antidepressants, one of which being mum and another two being literally my closest friends. So i probably speak more from experience rather than knowledge :/ As for the addiction thing, i have heard that being weaned off them is completely feasible although admittedly not a lot of fun, but neither is year upon year of deep depression. I think your last point about reality is really interesting, and wanders into philosophy to be honest."
t3_2yrgi3,cpcb3au,"I'm not going to argue with any of the points you've made because, when it comes to policy, I agree that women should be generally excluded for the reasons you've listed. I was an infantry Marine for 5 years and my (admittedly limited) experience with female Marines was almost entirely negative. What I want to address is this: First, you didn't cheat anyone out of anything."
