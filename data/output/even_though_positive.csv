t3_2r3fa4,cnc4l6o,"Essentially your argument is that our moral obligations stem entirely from our individual beliefs. Assuming you do not believe in hell (though maybe you do, I don't know) you are claiming that even though you don't believe this place exists, you think that someone who genuinely does believe such a place exists has the moral obligation to prevent people from being sent there - even though you would say that they are mistaken that there is such a place. So my response to that is this: if someone genuinely believed that a deity had told them to kill another person (or multiple people) in order for both they and he to achieve salvation, would you argue that it is moral for them to do so?"
t3_2qrbaf,cn9b6ar,"And I tried. I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot. I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time."
t3_2qb4ra,cn4kqwf,"It's like playing poker with players who never bet: it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog. That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design (even though it can be unfun in some scenarios); it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy. I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades."
t3_2p3z06,cmt7f8t,"For instance, per the CDC regarding Flu treatment: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm No, not everything can be treated, but going in and getting antibiotics may prevent you from getting pneumonia for instance. The two situations don't overlap completely, but, clearly employers think it's worth it, even though the more their health care is used, the greater their premiums. URL that's at least similar: Honestly, I can't think of a decent search term to pull up the appropriate study, but many cases of things like pneumonia patients think they might just have bronchitis or a cough, but if a doc listens to your lungs they can diagnose pneumonia."
t3_2ovqav,cmr1iii,"Everyone in the ground combat elements either knows or has seen someone like this. They buy pouches for their pouches, a dozen aftermarket accessories for their weapon that they don't even use properly and spray paint those accessories in earth tones even though they roll around in a giant fucking truck you can see from a mile away. They do their level best to look like a Call of Duty cover model and just end up looking like a douchebag."
t3_2ovqav,cmramno,"Think of it this way: you would think that rugby would be a much more dangerous sport than football because rugby players don't wear pads, but that isn't the case. The NFL is having problems with concussions and TBI even though they wear helmets and facemasks, rugby players the world over don't have the same problem wearing nothing more than a scrum cap. So what gives?"
t3_2okad4,cmo8ojn,"And it's not like Hazel ran around shouting it. She reminded herself that even though life seems unfair, she can still make the most of it. It might seem weird, but that little sentence from her favorite book helped her rationalize her cancer."
t3_2oihml,cmnhr07,"In the case where the person C is unaware of the relationship between A &amp; B I would agree. However, when person C is aware of a pre-existing relationship, even though he does not directly know person B and does not therefore have a meaningful connection to ""owe"" him anything, he is disrespecting person B by knowingly facilitating person A's breach of their social contract. Person C at that point has become an accessory to the infidelity, an accomplice if you will."
t3_2nokg9,cmftzma,"The pacifist may have longer term goals than you. They may think that even though they can reduce next weeks major violence by committing minor violence today, they may be concerned about setting a precedent of violence that will last long into the future. They may believe that their example will pave the way for a dramatic and longer lasting reduction in violence years from now."
t3_2n900k,cmbi11m,"I think the concept of going to start one's own nation is not analogous to changing jobs due to the amount of work required. Instead, the best option would be to change the system, since that is part of the ""contract"" I'm in with the government even though I never consented to it. A problem I have with your argument here is that it seems to assume that the policies of a government or company are stagnant."
t3_2mesct,cm3nquu,"Yes, but the experience is personal and to what extent it is enjoyed subjective. Some people (even though they are a visibly smaller group) really just enjoy this initial buildup. - Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience."
t3_2lxha7,clz4fjz,"As the article says, I agree that it's difficult for parents to make decisions about their infant's future sex life. My parents had my brother circumcised even though their doctor told them it was medically unnecessary because they were worried that my brother would feel weird in later locker room and/or sexual situations when most of his peers would also be cut, statistically speaking. I think that in matters that will have an enormous effect on a person's self-esteem, social life, emotional life, etc., it is best to wait as long as possible to allow the child to have some say in their own future."
t3_2lqcby,clx99dx,"Speech is constitutionally protected no matter whether it's called public health or public safety or something else. The reason is that the first amendment protects the behavior, even though it's repulsive. Most cases of street harassment could not possibly be made criminal in accordance with current first amendment law."
t3_2kfldi,clkve20,"The thing is that powerful followers of radical islam take great efforts to keep education away from people, so the two go hand-in-hand. Never said it wasn't, my point was that if you are going to go after the Bible for promoting violence, but give the Quran a pass, even though it has hundreds of verses promoting religious intolerance, then you are not being very philosophically consistent(not saying you are specifically, but there are plenty that do.). Many people who cry islamophobia have no issues with criticizing christians for their misdeeds, even though their actions towards people are lesser by comparison."

Many people who cry islamophobia have no issues with criticizing christians for their misdeeds, even though their actions towards people are lesser by comparison. Female genital mutilation isn't a part of the Bible, though."
t3_2k19cr,clgz8mq,"I can in fact get all the nutrition required for healthy living without consuming products that cause animals to suffer, so I feel it is most moral for me to do so. In fact I still feel that what I wrote above holds even though I eat meat now (we're all flawed I guess). My first girlfriend was horribly allergic to soy, and lots of other things including chocolate."
t3_2k19cr,clgz8mq,She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so. If I were to try to enforce my beliefs about moral dieting on others (something I wouldn't do btw) it would have to be very conditional.
t3_2k16fy,clh464b,"Can you explain how do you have sexual orientation without gender? Is a couple with a m-f transgender and male partner gay, even though the man feels he is dating a women (but biologically male). Personally I feel as a society we put too much stock in this stuff (love whoever i don't care)."
t3_2jd1e2,clal24g,"Characters in ads now have cult followings like Mayhem, Flo, the old spice guy, and the most interesting man in the world. So even though you still have to sit through a bunch of ads during commercial breaks, the chances of one of those ads appealing to you are much higher because that sort of evolution was actually needed for advertisement to continue on TV. This brings me back to the original point."
t3_2jaiv1,cl9wvir,Many legal growers and marijuana shop owners have essentially made marijuana their lifestyle. Do you what these people have done even though they make up the medical marijuana industry that you support? 
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"I'd rather reckon someone who who they are - isn't it nobler to accept them for that? Isn't it nobler to treat them equally, even though you are different? Isn't it more worthy an undertaking to transcend and go above racial concerns, rather than try to ignore that racial differences even exist?"
t3_2il5rb,cl3468o,"It wouldn't make sense to say that our problem is something that women need to resolve with their personal behavior. I don't blame Reddit for distracting me from my work, even though it's readily available. "
t3_2i6l9n,ckzcg4f,"It's a bit shortsighted to assume that just because they can possibly afford to this in the right now, that it's a sensible and practical decision for the long term. Many people have covered the idea that you can't judge someone else's finances, so I'm not going to go into that even though it is key here. There are two other points you seemingly haven't considered: What is the cost of having the mom stay home?"
t3_2i17u3,ckxvexx,"Sometimes, if you really love someone, you care for their happiness enough to know that you're not the person that will make them happy. You let them go, even though you love them, because their happiness is more important than your happiness. "
t3_2hiuav,ckt28ag,"Windows 8 was clearly designed around tablets, which is fine , but what works for tablets for UI design doesn't translate to mouse and keyboard. Imagine using iOS or Android on your desktop, and tell me that Apple would benefit from switching from OSX to iOS for their operating system on a Mac Pro (even though you don't like Mac) Second EDIT: These two things are mutually inclusive; Windows 8 does not exist in a vacuum. You cannot say that Windows 8 is bad or good without comparison in any meaningful way, because if Windows 8 were the only operating system, it would be both the best and the worst operating system ever, quite literally."
t3_2hcri1,ckrjgy3,"Could I get a delta for changing your view back again, then ? :p Because even though your edit is right, your initial view still makes a point. Even though its morally wrong to deliberately and significantly fuck someone else up with your laziness, you could still be unproductive to society without that happening."
t3_2gutfw,ckmsso5,"There are more races in Africa than in the rest of the world combined. Pygmies are very different from Bantu, even though both are listed as black. Even describing Obama's father as Kenyan misses a lot."
t3_2gutfw,ckmsso5,"So Alice and Bob's great grandkids' great grandkids are each either 127/128 race A or 127/128 race B (if I counted that right). But the descendants of Charlie are just as closely related to the descendants of Christina, David, and Delilah... even though Charlie and Christina's descendants are predominantly race A and David and Delilah's descendants are predominantly race B. Of course, what happens after seven generations or so is that the definition of race changes ."
t3_2gliyk,ckkaypu,"There was some hope that eventually costs would decline and it would be viable on its own (this has happened in the solar industry), but no such luck. Remember thay even though there have only been 3 major nuclear disasters, there are only about 400 nuclear power plants worldwide. That suggests the rate of failure of nuclear power plants is a bit lower than 1%, but that is misleading because many of those plants are relatively new (I think about half built since Chernobyl), so the true rate could be as high as 2-5%."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"But now, things are quite different, and it's probably fair to say that all of a sudden you may now feel bad feelings instead of positive feelings. It may now seem unfair and impossible to accomplish anything in life and the friendly competitive drive may turn to depression and despair, even though you yourself, really have not changed. Sure this story is contrived and extreme, but the result, sooner or later of almost any type of self comparison situation is still pretty much the same or at least runs a high risk of seeing this type of outcome."
t3_2bhy5s,cj5m2r2,"If a hotshot graduate chemistry student discovers some amazing new compound while working for the University, they are more likely than not going to receive any kind of compensation other than recognition for it. Recognition that will go a long way towards them securing themselves a future, even though it may not come immediately in financial terms because their discovery belongs to the University. Student athletes get in scholarship programs are being fairly compensated, walk-ons are volunteers there in the spirit of amateur sports; outstanding student athletes gain recognition in the same vein as the amazing chemistry grad student."
t3_29twg4,ciohbmn,Laws are about striking a balance between eliminating every potential harm and allowing people liberty (which is a good in and of itself). We allow cheese burgers even though obesity is a huge issue because the liberty of being able to eat them is worth more to society than the health benefits from banning them. Likewise listening to music when driving.
t3_29koa9,ciluvuu,"Also, you put too much emphasis on the success of a scoring attempt. There are plenty of shots on goal, even though most of them are saved. What's more exciting than a goalie diving to make a last-minute deflection?"
t3_28yh06,cig4wo1,"Maybe Vince pressured him to drop to Lesnar so that push could help generate interest in his limited appearances. Maybe Taker wanted to lose to a legit fighter (even though it was a WWE match). I mean, I'm sure someday Calaway( or someone else who knows what's gone on) will talk about it... most likely in one of those post-retirement retrospectives they make for us smarks."
t3_27hf7o,ci1a4gk,"A person working full time off of minimum wage would make about $15,000 a year. Should they all be compensated evenly, even though some of them obviously lost more than others? That hardly sounds fair."
t3_27dypa,ci0bdgm,"Whether or not you put yourself at a disadvantage is completely irrelevant. If Jessie sees Jamie fall and hit their head on a rock - let's say for the sake of argument that Jessie knows Jamie has a concussion - then proceeds to have sex with Jamie even though they know Jamie would never consent to it otherwise, that's rape. It doesn't matter that Jessie did not personally hit Jamie with the rock, what does matter is that Jessie took advantage of Jamie when Jessie knew they were in a more coherent state of mind than Jamie was."
t3_26b1l1,chpkxvq,"Race is real like money, and national borders, and adoption, and the meaning of these squiggles I'm writing with--it's real because enough people collectively agreed that it was real and gave it importance. It isn't biologically or intrinsically real (even though we tried to find its 'location' so to speak) and it shouldn't matter, but thanks to the actions of the past (and present) it continues to be real. Racism makes no sense because these differences are based in our treatment of each other, our preference for one person or another, our limiting of people by their colour or nationality...not on something inherent."
t3_24sb0f,cha6mi6,"With alcohol there is a dose related legal limit, typically a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08. Below this you can drive legally, even though you've been exposed to alcohol/have it in your system. Wouldn't it make more sense to have a dose limited system for these other drugs?"
t3_23fvx5,cgyony8,"Therefore, the race of the woman you have a child with would have no effect on your son's penis size. Okay, even though Asian men may indeed have smaller penises, penis size is a trait carried on the Y-chromosome, meaning that only males have the genes for it. Therefore, the race of the woman you have a child with would have no effect on your son's penis size."
t3_21hpd2,cgd84zz,"Furthermore (and this leads into the issue of consciousness), the dog will eventually resign itself to its situation. In the experiments I mentioned, the dogs eventually resigned themselves to the situation; even though they still had energy they stopped trying to escape. That is to say, the dog learned ."
t3_20bc4h,cg1k60u,"You don't trust anyone else to do right by them. You think that they are good people even though they have issues. It's definitely a lot harder than raising children who don't have such issues, but the joy comes in when you feel that you are genuinely helping them through life, and when you see them express their gratitude and love to you for doing so."
t3_2067hy,cg0du69,"But it looses that edge of greasiness and sounds more nicely gritty. I won't claim they're my all time favorite instrument (that honor goes to bagpipes, if you'd like to consider a real ""egomaniacal contrarian"" choice), but Philip Glass really changed how I hear saxes, even though they're alone here and not harmonizing with other instruments like you requested, but if you learn to like them by themselves maybe you can translate that to jazz. "
t3_1zyxf5,cfykpyh,"During the Cuban missile crisis, the American military leadership believed wholeheartedly that the Russians/Cubans would not respond to a military invasion of Cuba with nuclear weapons. What they didn't know at the time (but found out after the Cold War) is that the Cubans, at least, were perfectly willing to use nuclear weapons even though the Soviets were not. In short, if states are rational actors and consider material factors, Waltz is right that more nukes means less war."
t3_1zs621,cfwvfc8,"Three takeaways: 1. Up until pretty recently, even though most people were literate they didn't do much writing. 2."
t3_1zje7a,cfucreh,"We didn't ban alcohol or register drinkers. We don't have to have a background check to drink alcohol, even though we know some people shouldn't drink. It just doesn't have to be that way."
t3_1zdgxp,cfspefn,"It's like the difference between frozen orange juice concentrate and juice freshly squeezed from oranges. There is not comparison even though they are technically the same product. I also don't understand this whole ""classy"" thing."
t3_1y5jpe,cfhjc63,"How about someone who, say, brutally raped a dozen prepubescent girls, causing massive irreparable internal damage, and left them beaten and broken? Gotta say that even though I oppose the death penalty, I'd be a lot quicker to pull the switch on scum like that than someone who, say, planned the murder of his wife's lover. "
t3_1xqnjx,cfdsxp9,"The other thing you have to remember about teaching in college is that college students are supposed to be more independent in their studies than in grade school, meaning that if they want to use their laptops/tablets and distract themselves by going on the internet instead of listening during class then they will ultimately face the consequences with a worse grade. Also, you might have noticed that I excluded the use of cellphones in this because in my experience students don't necessarily use cellphones for educational purposes in class but rather to distract themselves (even though they can be used for almost anything a tablet can be used for). "
t3_1xqbkw,cfdnoww,"You feel like a normal, two-armed person in every way, but you have this third arm flopping around constantly reminding you that you're different. This might naturally cause you a lot of distress since people are going to treat you differently, even though you're just like them on the inside. You talk to someone about getting it removed, and they laugh and explain that it's just how you were born and you're silly for thinking you should only have two arms."
t3_1xny71,cfd4qsf,"No openly gay characters, episodes like the one where they introduce the Trill or where they had the gender neutral people (both TNG) were supposed to be allegories for gay people but the episodes were neutered (for instance by casting all the neutral people with women so Riker wouldn't kiss a man). Even the first lesbian kiss they overtly insisted that it was really a former man and a former woman kissing and not two women even though physically it was two women. Why do I bring this all up?"
t3_1x3quk,cf82a08,"They're placed on reddit, and upvoted by redditors, specifically because the posters and voters thought, in their heart of hearts, despite what polite society would have us think, that they could bring joy to a whole lot of people by sharing a simple photo with others. Thus, that picture of a girl's ass filling up most of your front page as you scroll down the page is representative of what makes reddit a beautiful, magical place: that things are shared out of kindness and upvoted with goodwill, and even though we may not agree with everyone on the site, even though we might despise a lot of the content, we know that we're mostly just decent people who are looking to enjoy ourselves for a little while on the internet, and we're not going to spoil some arbitrary rules about what is acceptable in polite company ruin our good time. If the unfortunate side-effect is that you have to occasionally see some naked pictures because you don't want to stick to your front page rather than /r/all AND you don't want to turn of NSFW posts then, well, maybe its something you should just let go."
t3_1wi4dg,cf3apv9,"Usually those types of people don't get much attention, at least compared to groups like the Westboro Baptist Church, but I believe that many people are like that. Paula Deen was plenty nice to African-Americans even though she was secretly a massive racist the entire time. If a gay couple's car broke down, I'm sure some Boy Scouts would help them just the same as they would anyone else."
t3_1wd6jq,cf0vo2d,"This property is called ""Heavy dependance on initial conditions"". Now, one could say that even though we don't know the initial conditions, there have been set in stone and that's what they are. It is here that quantum mechanics come into play."
t3_1v6x7z,cepcqsx,We can't force veterans to call the crisis hotline when they're feeling stressed. We can't deny veterans their right to purchase weapons at their leisure even though those who own a weapon are more likely to commit suicide. I don't have a solution to the problem.
t3_1ut0dy,celg0sb,"Imagine how much more technology will advance in the next few? When the space shuttle was retired just a couple years back, its computer systems were all incredibly outdated, even though they were first constructed in the 1980's. The whole line of space shuttles had outlived its useful lifespan in only 20 or 30 years because it would have been prohibitively expensive to upgrade them to modern standards."
t3_1uhj8f,cei5r73,"Yet many people in philosophy of mind still don't think it is likely to be true. Here is an illustration why: even though it seems too surprising, too incomprehensible that other hunks of meat in other human heads could give rise to conscious thought, that surprising-ness is just as real with regards to the hunks of meat in our own heads, and yet we have first-person direct acquaintance with our conscious experience nonetheless. Step back and don't think about your brain as ""yours"" but rather think about your brain as this physical object ""here"" and another person's brain as that physical object ""over there""."
t3_1u7llg,cefbw53,"Even if a person is partially responsible for being assaulted, does that not mean you can't have sympathy for them? Presumably you have sympathy for those who are victims of hurricanes or earthquakes or tornadoes, even though they are responsible for living in areas with an increased risk of natural disaster. If you got robbed while walking in a dangerous part of town, I'd still feel bad for you, even if you presumably could have taken steps to help reduce your risk."
t3_1tqttm,cealwzd,"You don't know where it will be or what the probability of that detonation are, but you know it's a possibility. I would argue that it's immoral to press the right button, because even though you'll be slightly convenienced, there is a chance that you'll act in a way that's very immoral. Eating meat, to me, is pressing the button on the right (I know it's hyperbolic, it's an example)."
t3_1rb6qj,cdlrdyo,"Now, an open-faced sandwich can be a ""sandwich"", in quotes. This is because it can share many characteristics with common real sandwiches that are known as such, and it can be treated like a sandwich even though it technically isn't one. By the way, not sandwiches?"
t3_1qwg8s,cdhe2ys,"I don't go out of my way to hide being vegan, but everyone who finds out (usually by means of going out to eat together at a place where I have to ask questions about ingredients, and often after already knowing me for a long time) is surprised by the fact. Up until that point, they never counted me as a vegan, and there are plenty of people I know who don't count me as a vegan, so even though they've met a vegan who does not meet your stereotype, they don't make the association between my behavior and veganism. That selection bias is probably 90% of why that stereotype exists."
t3_1qwdul,cdh6jv3,"First, you get out of dating what you put into dating. I had a friend who was pretty similar to how you describe, and when he tried the PUA route he got even more frustrated because he was feeling less connected to the people he was meeting, even though he felt more confident about meeting people. Second, and this is related to the first, I think what might help you is spending some time by yourself really getting to know yourself."
t3_1qwdul,cdigp3t,"Is this a recent thing, or have you always had a hard time connecting with women? Because even though I'm a man, if I were a woman, we went out on a date, and (assuming you're as great as you claim) I got this laundry list of accomplishments out of you, my first thought would be ""what is wrong with this guy that he's made it to 29 without anybody locking him down?"" That is, of course, spectacularly unfair, but obviously you wonder this, so why shouldn't I?"
t3_1qw6q4,cdh7j9w,"People don't include their interpretation of ""typical"" when they use the word. It would have to be: ""It is typical for dates to split the check or take turns paying because it is a common practice, even though culturally we assume that the guy is going to pay and that may still be the most common."" Trying to include the word ""typical"" just complicates the entire statement you're trying to make, because you have to take the effort to qualify how you mean typical (the part that says ""because it's a common practice)."
t3_1qw6q4,cdh7j9w,"She has to then wonder to herself: does he mean typical because of most common? Because it's accepted even though it's not the most common? What does he mean by ""typical?"""
t3_1qfy2y,cdcoftz,"If you're sharing hobbies and he picked a book series, well, that's not exactly a hobby, but maybe it means he considers the books part of him, and feels somewhat rejected that you don't like them. I think it's also possible (speaking as someone whose ex-wife loved knitting even though knitting is literally the most boring thing in the world) (no offense) that what he actually likes about knitting isn't knitting itself but feeling closer to you by sharing these things you love, and that when you refuse to share back, it feels like the thing he liked about knitting basically evaporates. I can't exactly offer a defense of ASOIAF that will make a difference to you, because the things you dislike are obviously part of the work and those elements remain part of the work throughout."
t3_1qe6d9,cdbzgva,"Here's the thing, though: to a Catholic theologian, [everyone is strongly inclined towards sin. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concupiscence) So, while Francis said it better, both Popes have said that the Church should fight homophobia, even though homosexual sex isn't something the Church endorses. Also, while he wasn't the most effective at dealing with the child abuse scandal, URL Back to Benny 16's nerdiness, though; he really wasn't good at seeing how outsiders perceive the Church."
t3_1qa50u,cdasnci,But you are trying to force me to subscribe to voluntarism when I want the democratic republican government that we have now. I ought to be able to consent to that form of government even though it may be imperfect and sometimes I do not always get what I want. Can you explain further how voluntarism deals with a situation of someone who steals something and won't give it back or someone who constantly murders?
t3_1pp78v,cd4jxtx,The problem is compounded by the fact that oftentimes people who are mentally ill and may not be capable of reliably or accurately speaking about their situation in an objective way. Advocating for these people to kill themselves may result in them doing it even though their situation may have improved. And it's permanent.
t3_1pet4o,cd1sa3b,"While the article focuses on banking, I think the same principles apply to law, consulting, business management, and any other client-focused industry. I'd summarize the post here, but its probably easier to just read for yourself (even though it has some jargon in it.) You have to keep in mind that productivity loss is not the only cost here."
t3_1n3wo2,ccfmxhg,"Option 2, making vaccination mandatory by deporting those who refuse to be vaccinated, seems grossly unjust to me. While it is unfair that people receive protection from others who get vaccinated even though they don't contribute to protecting others by getting vaccinated themselves, it seems far more unfair to force those who don't wish to protect others by getting vaccinated to leave their homes to another country. So, while permitting the free riders protection is unfair, not permitting them protection by deporting them is far more unfair."
t3_1mdwb3,cc8dkwo,"As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a >50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty. In Scot's law (IANAL but I'm pretty sure of this) there's an ""innocent"" verdict in addition to ""guilty"" and ""not guilty""- you might be able to argue that in situations in which an innocent verdict were returned the accuser should face trial, but even then you're going to discourage the reporting of abuse on the off-chance the abuser prepares for it and fabricates some kind of alibi"
t3_1mdfzf,cc86nl7,"Our early (and perhaps later) exposure to hormones can change our _sensitivity_ to those hormones, and sometimes what matters for behaviour is the sensitivity we have, not the absolute levels. So if testosterone makes someone agressive, for example, a man and a woman could both have a spike to become equally aggressive with a testosterone boost, even though the absolute levels could be very different. Note, the above is conjecture..."
t3_1lt0gt,cc2od32,"With enough attention change may come about, whether it leads to an internal reform of how things are done, people voting a certain/different way or an all out revolution. Now to address specific complaints toward Obama and the desire to remove him, this goes back to the idea that even though he was elected, he's not living up to the expectations of those who elected him. If I had to buy a car and chose the 'best of what was offered' and ended up with a car that didn't run at all after a week, I'd want a new car."
t3_1l6jx5,cbwinoh,"Neither of us know the exact science, but I think anyone can make an educated risk assessment. If it's 5 or 10% healthier, would you feel vindicated, even though the difference is almost negligible? If it was 5 or 10% worse, would you throw away all your rolling papers and change your ways?"
