t3_2r4u3k,cncnikt,"If there is absolutely no connection between clothing choices and professionalism then it should be perfectly fine for an employee dressed in jeans and a tee-shirt to make a house call. Yet you are willing to concede that clothing choice has a strong enough impact on customers that there could be negative implications if employees don't adhere to a certain standard. Shouldn't you also be willing to accept that these kinds of negative implications could take place in an internal setting, given that the employees of your company were often raised in a similar (or the same) society that the customers grew up in?"
t3_2qia6o,cn76xcf,"Again, this seems like total BS from all angles, and I think this is actually bad hiring practices from the company's perspective. I'll certain concede that its bad and happens, but to me this isn't a criticism of ""networking"" in a broad sense. Well, there's a certain ""unfairness"" that will inevitably exist just due to the status quo."
t3_20c7cz,cg1uasx,"Ehh, singular they is still such a grey area. I'll concede it's historical usage (since clearly it was used as such), but to quote from that wiki article, ""A reason for its use is that English has no dedicated singular personal pronoun of indeterminate gender. "" It's an added usage of the word because English is lacking in this one area."
t3_1u8iv1,cegf2xb,Now it is another argument to say that I don't want this to happen because I like manual driving. I will concede this. I also feel the same way.
t3_1ppyu1,cd5an9q,"No matter how you define antagonist and protagonist, you can still write a story from the protagonist's POV. First of all, I'm going to concede that when I defined the protagonist as the main character, I should have said that it tends to be the main character. An example of this is The Lord of the Rings, where I think we can agree Frodo is the protagonist and main character."
t3_1pkj0y,cd42fc3,"I'm going to give you a little more about ""having the Senate, where every state has the same number of delegates, allows everyone to have a voice in Congress."" First, I'll concede that everyone has a voice in Congress. But the devil's in the details."
t3_1dxzgg,c9uy08t,"At the very least it has got you here asking questions. I will concede that when I first became a full vegetarian (when I was 12), several of my friends jumped along for the ride, so to speak. None lasted very long and seemed to only be doing it because of my influence."
t3_1d7g4o,c9nwpbl,"(2c) On the contrary society's morals have increased as life has got easier. (2d) I will concede that rich people (subject to the least pain) are less moral than the middle class, but at the same time being subjected to poverty often thrusts people towards a more violent, prejudiced and criminal life style. This is not what the theory would predict."
t3_2s38n0,cnms6pr,"Which publication actually printed their own except in solidarity with victims of terror attacks? (If you find me an example of where I am wrong I will happily concede my point and consider myself more educated because of it, so please do!) "
