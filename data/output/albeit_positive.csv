t3_2pp7pp,cmyupjh,"In others, any deviation from the subreddit hivemind is met instantly with the ban-hammer (here's looking at you, /r/Feminism). CMV itself has quite aggressive moderation, albeit on different grounds than you're talking about, yet most people are quite comfortable with it because the rules are clear and germane to the goal of keeping the sub ""on track"" so to speak. I tend to play ""devil's advocate,"" which often means taking an extreme position, yet only one of my posts here has ever been removed and it was reinstated shortly after based on a minor change in wording."
t3_2ox2nh,cmrepwp,"Spec wise, on similarly priced models of MBP 13 inch and SP3 ($1299): RAM: 8GB each Processor: 2.6GHz i5 on the Mac 1.9GHz i5 on the Surface Storage wise: 128Gb on the MBP, 256Gb on the Surface Graphics card: Intel Iris graphics on the MBP, Intel HD graphics 4200 on the Surface (The Iris is a better graphics card) Spec wise, the Mac wins in all but one category. I don't know how much more detail you want to go into, but a few other things worth mentioning: The Mac has a bigger screen (albeit one inch), is not much heavier, and has the beautiful Retina display. I don't want to go too Mac-vs.-PC-esque over here but I don't think many students would want to shell out for a newer operating system (one that so far in technical preview does not look all that significant, but things could change)."

t3_2g2dg1,ckf6526,"Almost all YouTube comments I see are intentional trolls or people trying to sound witty, I may be wrong if you're looking at very small channels, but YouTube comment section is not a good place to find discussion. Reddit frontpage isn't either (albeit slightly better than YT). It's a bit different here with iPhone vs ""Android"" because iOS is exclusive to the iPhone whereas Android phones have multiple manufacturers."

t3_2ctoax,cjl2zn4,"With the powers thusly divided, I hope you believe this leaves room for free will under the biblical god. Hey man, I think I got a good one, albeit kind of silly, if your still interested: God is the trinity, one being expressed as three separate but equal entities: the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Free will is consistent with an omniscient, omnipotent creator god because while God may be these things, no single entity has all three traits."
t3_2c0frm,cjar51s,"/r/atheism mostly retains a light tone when it comes to religion, but /r/Antitheism gets much more serious and doesn't not have any room of the joking nature of /r/atheism. This means that the subreddits hold a different (albeit very similar) content and therefore it is appropriate to have two separate subreddits. It is the same logic that prevents /r/funny and /r/AdviceAnimals from merging into a single subreddit."
t3_29wdwj,cip54i9,"How do you know who plays Magic The Gathering unless they tell you? I play Magic: The Gathering (albeit infrequently), and I WISH that I had a group to play Dungeons and Dragons with. They could come over to my nice, clean house."
t3_23xw5n,ch1nret,"(Okay, admittedly the first world problems thing was a bit sardonic. :)); I consider myself fortunate, reasonably, though not wealthy by American standards (I have a car made in a post-2010 year, albeit a Fiesta.) I'll address as much as I can, but I'm running a bit nocturnal lately; I think we're in agreement on a lot; I should have said that I think a lot of people take their problems with ""the rich"" as a group a bit too focused on any one rich individual."
t3_2225gv,cgimlkk,"Going back, trust is what makes society work, and what protects us from wild animals. Notice that it says ""recognize"" and not ""get completely enveloped in""; there is a huge difference in the two, albeit it is a difference of magnitude. My empathy is what allows me to sit down with a grieving friend and offer some semblance of comfort."
t3_21w3iu,cgh85yd,"); Also, it is entirely possible that when someone argues using logic in that manner, it is because they feel they or their viewpoints are being attacked, and it is actually an emotional response to that attack, rather than pure logic, despite logical constructs being used for the actual argument. This brings me to the main point of this whole wall of text: Logic and Emotions are not opposites, nor are they mutually exclusive ; some people react to the anger stimulus (albeit as a trained response) by becoming scathingly logical, for lack of a better term. But regardless of that, it is entirely possible to be emotional while being logical (albeit not perfectly logical at times) and your point about passion is proof of that."

t3_213mm2,cg9agr0,"Finally, nobody attacks ""theories"" that are not academically correct, because there is no such thing. Theories are just ideas, albeit generally on the more developed side. People attack assertions of fact that are not adequately supported by observation and experimentation."
t3_1vi0cy,cesxob1,"What about gorillas and other apes that can understand symbolic communication? You know, the ones that can type, or put words/symbols together to form sentences (albeit syntactically poor sentences)? Are our lives infinitely more valuable than theirs?"
t3_1klpoz,cbqe15e,"And the other bands know it too. The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles (and the Beatles by them in return, just listen to URL ), and I would argue that you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, albeit more subtle. They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate, be it in musical quality, diversity of material, evolution, quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan, and mass appeal."
t3_1h8lmm,cary5pj,"It's not uncommon to run into what they call ""dry drunks"" in the meetings. People who have essentially replaced one addiction with another, albeit a much healthier one (being ""addicted"" to being in AA vs. being addicted to the drink). One of the main tenets of any 12-step program is the need for character change."
t3_1dahpy,c9oiwum,"Like when someone dumps a pile of trash out into a road or into a lake. They made an irresponsible choice that will have a negative effect on other people, albeit not as endangering as drunk driving. There are also a lot of people who don't drink and drive, but have a lot of bad habits when they drive inhibiting their judgement (putting on makeup, eating food, texting, shaving [yes i've seen it]) that can be just as bad, or even worse than having alcohol in your body."
