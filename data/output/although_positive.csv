t3_2pkvb6,cmxr4yg,"Why do you think that might be? Pain is a physical and mental response to trauma although when you're feeling it pain takes on nuance. Annoying, stinging, burning, aching, wrenching, stabbing, blinding."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Think on it and let me know. Thank you although I think the argument accomplishes both. My interpretation is they're arguing for experience.
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,"You might conclude ""existentialism is a hopeful response to a hopeless world"" and that's true, but it's also true that every person cited above had something equally damning and disturbing to say about life. Yes although I can only answer based on my personal experience. I've traveled."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Yet we do. We have total agency from an existential point of view although reality does assert itself early and often. We can still do things though.
t3_2p19c2,cmsmj84,"Ok, well, lets start with the abuses, just to prove that it is a problem that needs to be solved. Without going into it comprehensively, although it is very difficult to get complete numbers, here is a reasonable article about the number of people who are wrongfully killed by police in a year: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/ So, because there isn't great evidence, unless you have better evidence, I think it is safe to assume that this is accurate info. And that about 15% of deaths by police are abuses of some kind."
t3_2l6s0m,cls56tt,"I'm not saying that global warming is the ONLY cause for the ocean's URL , but I am saying that if the ocean dies, it will never ever come back the way it should be. My interest, although not yet my career, is marine biology, so I will look at this subject from an oceanographic point of view. The #1 concern for me is[ ocean acidification,](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F) which is happening now and everywhere, although most noticeably in my area of the world (Puget Sound, PNW)."

t3_2hxjbt,ckx4axr,"So it could be either. The Four Horsemen and Horsewoman generally defined atheism as being without belief, although Hitchens and HArris were particular fans of New Atheism, which wrapped rationalism and skepticism into the mix with atheism. American Athiests (www.athiest.org) disagrees with your strict definition as well."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrirh7,"In terms of skill he can demonstrate that in how skillfully he plays chess and fights. In terms of athleticism, everyone knows how exhausting it is to box (some professional boxers burn more calories than a professional footballer per hour (although this is more debatable)). "
t3_2g4ifu,ckfqk9u,"Now the main detraction from eating bone-in wings becomes solely economical, and I often find myself willing to spend a few extra dollars for an order of wings which I would deem of slightly higher appeal as graded by my threefold wing criteria. I used to agree with you fully on this, as what I really want out of eating wings is threefold: Moist chicken meat
 Flavourful(usually spicy) sauce * A satisfying exterior(smooth for wet wings, crisp or breaded for dry wings) I had always found eating bone-in wings to be quite unavailing as although they very well encapsulated my three desires of chicken wings, eating them was too: messy, costly and time consuming. I thusly turned to bone-out or boneless wings to satisfy my chicken based cravings, which although satisfying, often fell a bit short of the standard imposed by the bone-in wing."

t3_2fuvyn,ckd2th4,"It is worth distinguishing between three things: (a) Only having one sexual partner during your lifetime, (b) waiting to become sexually active with your partner (in whole or in part) until after marriage or some other form of commitment, and (c) rushing into marriage in order to become sexually active with your partner. Of these three, only C seems potentially dangerous to me, although (of course) people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C. Now if A (one life-partner) is fine without C, then B must be pretty harmless without C, as well... if you do all your sexual experimentation with one partner, you are going to end up in pretty much the same place eventually, whether you start in the back seat of your parents' car or the bridal suite. Note that teenagers are immensely insecure about their romantic prowess and sexual relationships."
t3_2e4crb,cjvy9v7,"Provision for the guerilla war we'll need to fight when an alien war machine arrives from the other end of the universe to assimilate us? While I would accept that it could mean any of these things, I'd argue it's not incontrovertibly true that it does mean any of them in particular (although I would suspect that to many, defense from foreign invasion would be the concern that would trump all others). You can definitely find perspectives from some of the founding fathers that support the view that the second amendment should act as a check on the government's own potential for tyranny, but that is true of pretty much everything that's in the constitution; you can consult the various founders' written views on everything and end up with a wealth of disagreement as to what purpose each article and amendment's should serve, as well as to their limits and purview."
t3_2dtng7,cjt0gp1,"Because it hasn't happened yet. Therefore, you can have an omniscient God who doesn't know what I'm going to do way before I do it, although he would know what I've done as soon as I do it. Now, this can create some problems for some people."
t3_2d80rd,cjn0zyz,"The ""pre-chorus"" is: This sounds like she is maybe married. ""Tried to domesticate you"" and ""You don't need no papers"" seem like she is separated but not divorced, although it could just be that he's comparing her to an animal and saying she doesn't need ""papers"" meaning a pedigree ... which is still gross. Here is the main part of the song's chorus that seems really questionable: It sounds like he is saying that the ""blurred lines"" are if she's too drunk to consent."
t3_2cfco7,cjf04a9,"Even then, POI doesn't always cause infertility, it can also cause subfertility (reduced egg production and menstruation, but still there). I am female, and although I have an irregular cycle, I do ovulate and could have children one day. My lowered estrogen levels are treated with birth control pills."
t3_2b3lad,cj1iybx,"Paying the President more isn't going to lead to more effective leadership. Also, although the salary of the President isn't that amazing, the perks are ridiculous, and opportunity to make money after the job is over is better than for 99% of athletes. "
t3_2b39o5,cj1ixk2,"The only problem I see is that asserting the lack of a demo as a legitimate reason for piracy can be seen as expecting a demo from the devs/publishers. Wanting to play a game before buying it is a separate desire from wanting to play a demo; and although there is some overlap between the two, demos are different from the final game. Pirating a game to play it to ascertain the flaws and merits purchasing it would have, is different than pirating a game to serve as a demo."
t3_2b39o5,cj1jj7u,"I guarantee they did this to entice people to buy said game. What I am getting at is although you insist it is the lack of a demo that pushes you to piracy, it i instead the lack of a way to experience the game prior to purchasing it. I'm well aware 50% + of this thread has been trying to convince you of the merits of onlive video/text review, and I understand that although they believe these methods to work for them personally, they do not in fact work for you."

t3_2a7f52,cisbwf3,"There are some great eps in there, but also farting aliens the fans pretend don't exist. In many ways I think 11's first episode is a better starting point and not much is lost by starting there although it would be necessary to go back through 9 and 10 for the 50th special to make sense. The show has always had it's ups and downs and even seasons that are regarded as excellent such as season 3 have three of the best episodes of all time and 2 of the worst."
t3_2a2ccx,ciqt1fb,"then it should be considered alright to cold call people as well. In fact, although those phone calls annoy me as well, I think they can be a very helpful political advertising tool. I say this because cold-calling is a means of political advertising that is actually accessible to candidates without a massive campaign budget."

t3_26z994,ci473oh,"IMO Situations I do mean: Going to a private residence with someone that has not yet earned your trust (unless you have fantastic people instinct), taking them back to your home, in a house party setting going to a secluded area where people can't really see you, etc. The reason I 'encourage this fear' is that, although the sense that I was/am small 'prey' starting developing in my late teens, it didn't actually hit home until after I was sexually assaulted. And that's true for other women that I know as well."
t3_26klj1,chs24pt,"There is hope. I do not substantially disagree with your main point (although your take on it seems a bit negative to me). I would like to address what you say here though: This part is often untrue, and seems a bit pessimistic."
t3_26b7qy,chpe7k0,"To me, the idea of cutting taxes on big business is not really about helping that business directly, but rather increase economic freedom to allow the surplus to trickle down.

Maybe instead of pushing for earlier human testing you should be thinking pharmaceutical companies should be made more aware that animal models aren't necessarily accurate so they shouldn't ditch drugs that cause non-fatal side effect, especially if the drug shows exceptional promise in treating the disease (although I wouldn't be surprised if this was already the case) "
t3_24dj00,ch63o4o,"Are you, in this CMV, confusing insufferable people with anyone who might use ""cis-gendered"" as an accurate term to distinguish between various sexual/gender identities? As do I, although usually silently and to, hopefully, no great effect on my behavior. But those are insufferable people regardless of their circumstances."

t3_225n20,cgjse9y,"For me, being genderfluid means that at any given time I feel female or male, and on a blue moon a bit of neither. There isn't some determination made by the activity I'm doing, although there are certain things that exaggerate what would be termed as dysphoria.

This isn't a small problem."
t3_21rsdj,cgg2pxh,"I also don't think that books are the only source of good reading: I'm always on the lookout for expansive content-dense websites that contain interesting information that I've never seen before.

t3_21rsdj,cgfwsxp,"May it be a description or what some characters are feeling/thinking. If you like fiction, you are made to imagine scenarios and completely different characters which is much more stimulating than watching a movie where the whole imaginative 'work' is done for you (although I am a huge fan of LOTR, both books and films, nut that's beyond the point). Books like 1984 or Brave New World 'plant' new ideas in your brain, those books make you think and form an opinion of your own."
t3_20iv9v,cg3y5m7,"Allowing everyone time to fully debate the merits rather than calling a snap election (held basically as soon as the ballots could be printed) should be a prerequisite to such an election being considered legitimate. I have no problem in concept with the idea of Crimea choosing to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, although I think that they should also allow sub-regions of Crimea to secede from Crimea. I am skeptical of Russia's involvement because Russia does not allow Chechnya, Dagestan, and other disaffected regions of Russia to secede from Russia."

t3_1xzdek,cfg1zzx,"It is like the difference between someone hating you for liking a certain kind of music and someone hating you for being black. One has the potential to hinder your sense of self more, although I know that isn't universal and many atheists have a lot of issues with this as well. I know that atheism isn't a choice but at least for me, it doesn't feel as connected to my identity as my sexual orientation."
t3_1xqloo,cfe0jv3,"Just that it is to much to say NEVER. If your CMV was ""I believe that you should actively question any beliefs you hold where a differing opinion exists"" or something like that I don't think I could honestly think of a counter point that isn't quiblling over definitions although to be fair that is just what I've done here. Solid argument there dude."
t3_1x6lp7,cf8k0qp,"I used to think like that a long time ago, too, but then I found out studies say ""no problem"". Here's one: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01679.x/abstract I don't think it would justify the term ""cancer"" anyway, although I will assume you did it for the shock value to get more replies and make it easier to get good reasons.

t3_1wdil8,cf110ff,"Six months? Either you have ""the right"" at any time frame that seems right to you (although that judgement will no doubt be impacted by your condition) or you need to wait a long time to earn the right because you might get better.

t3_1w6uhl,cezy174,"I've argued in defense of your position in response to others, and I do think that the other posters are a bit off the mark. However, although my wife and I are in the middle of the adoption process and are doing it by choice, there are some things I can say that might make IVF seem more reasonable to you. As I said elsewhere, among the most common issues with both adoption and IVF are cost, stress, and family acceptance."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"4. as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it."
t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"I'm not sure you can show that people don't take it seriously. I think men are less likely to report it as it's seen to be weak, but I think once reported it would be treated the same, although I don't have any stats, do you? "
t3_1v37km,ceof5q0,"Whereas /r/atheism can make fun of a public figure or a general religion, or a group of people, SRS attacks a username with a single person attached to it. I've heard claims that they've DoXed before as well, although I have no hard-proof of that. Basically when your venting comes at the expense of others that's no longer harmless and is closer to bullying."

t3_1ud8fv,cehjb3t,"In contrast, the ""Living Constitution"" movement generally strays further from the original text, and seeks to take current conditions into account when interpreting the text. So using the ""privacy"" example from above, although the word ""privacy"" does not exist in the text of the Constitution or its Amendments, recent jurisprudence (of the last 50-75 years) has found a qualitative right of privacy protected by various provisions of the Constitution, most notably the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.

t3_1rw7vg,cdrov9y,"Until basic human rights have been secured for women in such situations I think the focus on the female half of gender is morally sound and justifiable. Late to the party so not sure if anyone will see this: I think the real reason why we use the word ""Feminism"" is because we acknowledge that, although this is at heart an equality movement, many women are suffering to a much greater degree than men - and thus it is women that need to find a rallying ground in order to tackle their problems. Obviously men also have problems we need to address, and I wholeheartedly agree that men should be considered much more within the framework of feminism."
t3_1rqcx7,cdpu3pe,"Meth is a subtly different drug to crack due to its much slower metabolism time. It also appears to be less compulsive and addictive in the short term than crack, although we don't have enough studies of either for this to be much more than general observation from users.

What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and become insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count) That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)"

t3_1in64c,cb6akju,"The type of theory that religion preaches is normative theory, similar to some post-modern, Marxist theories and political theory - something much different than scientific theory. They are not descriptive, scientific theories but aim to develop standards, Generally speaking, although religions may make some claims about the universe (and claims without evidence, usually), there is a lot more non-scientific, descriptive discourse. Although Buddhism has scientific discourse on life - there is much more discourse and literature about rituals."
t3_1ii9vi,cb4uyp8,"If they have a fist you have a bat, if they have a knife, you have a gun, if they have a gun you have a bazooka. Now when you apply that to criminals, although they are looking for easy marks, eventually they will know that they need to carry and use a gun. This is demonstrated through the death rates of store clerks of stores that are known to carry firearms."
t3_1hz32h,cazg5yg,"Intelligence is like any other trait, including emotional stability, that not only comes in natural variety and intensity, but that evolves and takes on different characteristics over time. Having a high IQ is not like having high testosterone, but more like having specific ""gadgets"" in your body (not just the brain, although that's certainly ground zero for most of them) that perform specific functions. What we call intelligence is therefore the collective effect of those gadgets over time."
t3_1hz32h,caznbpr,"But do mental disorders come from greater complexity, or something else? Bipolar disorder, although I was in a hurry to talk about gadgets earlier, is chemical, and that's why we can treat it with drugs. Mental disorders occur to most mammals, which is why we use mice and chimpanzees to study some of these diseases."
t3_1gndd7,calxx48,"In which case, would it not change your view to discover that I regularly apply the 'toolsets' philosophers develop to solve 'pure' problems when I am stumped by an 'applied' problem? Or does this still fall foul of the fact that although finding non-trivial solutions to the problems might be insightful, the problems themselves are still trivial? Kind of like how you could develop calculus in response to the question of 'find the area of a square of a given length of side' but there is a simple, trivial solution involving squaring the length you have?"
t3_1g2qho,cag6n0x,"So I think it's a combination of growing up watching it and wanting to root for your city to win. It doesn't really have to do with how boring the sport is to watch or anything like that, although we do call soccer boring, it's just a cultural thing in that we are supposed to enjoy x sport , y sport, and z sport, but we shouldn't enjoy w sport. You probably hate watching American Football and baseball or atleast don't find it as engaging as soccer because you didn't grow up watching it and you don't have a connection to the teams playing."
t3_1fl5d8,cabci41,"This is simply a 'no true Scotsman' fallacy - it is not part of the definition of 'scientist' that you have a certain cluster of beliefs, only that you are (or were) engaged in the practice of science. It is your contention that in some sense Mendel was not 'honest' to other scientists because his groundbreaking work on genetics was carried out in a church, although quite what you believe a scientist must do to be 'honest' is not made clear - in the scientific method it literally doesn't matter whether the results you publish come to you in an LSD-induced hallucination as long as they are replicable by others, so how can it possibly matter whether your beliefs are coherent? You appear to have overlooked the possibility that there are some hypotheses which are not provable or disprovable."

t3_1dsz4r,c9tr6a5,"You can read the report at: http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf Here are direct quotes from the report: ""Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime"" ""For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%)."" The above, lifetime stats do show a lower percentage of male victims (up to 6.2% of all men) than female victims (18.3% of all women) although this is far more than commonly believed. However, if you look at the report's stats for the past 12 months, just as many number of men have been ""forced to penetrate"" as women were raped, meaning that if you properly include being ""made to penetrate"" in the definition of rape, men were raped as often as women."
t3_1di0zr,c9qn5bx,"Without a common faith to unite us we would still be roaming around in warring bands, we would never have acquired scientific knowledge to even understand that it can all be explained, in a sense God was required to lose faith in him. It might be possible to advance to a point where religion is not required anymore to keep morals and ethics alive, although it has never been tried, but not everyone has advanced that far yet. Morals and ethics do not come automatically, the genocides in sub sahara africa were only possible because their sense of morality and ethics hadn't had time to adapt to an actual civilization."
t3_1d44p3,c9mxd9o,"Evidence of this comes from the fact that antidepressants do not immediately work. Although it differs from person to person, it usually takes between 4 and 8 weeks for improvement to occur, although seeing effects after 2 weeks is not uncommon. Why this long time?"

One weekend I went to visit him and among other things he took me to one of his frat's invite-only parties."
t3_1aq5t2,c907asm,"I guess this isn't really a 'cmv' argument I am presenting but rather a way to re-frame the problem. My point is that people being idiots is not really the problem _per se_ (although it is damn frustrating) - the problem is rather that people are born into circumstances where being stupid is, for some reason, both a viable and attractive option.

t3_32br6b,cq9r1xc,"EDIT I'm getting a number of responses about drug laws, alcohol, prescription drugs, etc. I want to reiterate, I'm not make a stand one way or another on drug legislation (although I think it's silly that pot is illegal and alcohol isn't), simply that there is a long established tradition of putting ""the overall good of society"" (however that is defined) over ""personal freedom"" (again, insert your definition here). Where to draw the lines is certainly debatable, but no society gives personal freedom absolute weight over harm reduction."
t3_30piom,cpuvrbx,"BUT, for certain classes of businesses, called common carriers, they don't have this right to refuse because we decided the economy as a whole depends on them serving everyone. Examples of this are hotels, transport companies, and restaurants, although you can always ask people to leave for making a disturbance or bothering people (if your ex comes in just to be rude, for example). If places to eat and sleep can refuse people at will it supposedly hurts interstate commerce, because it makes travel harder."

t3_30059g,cpo9jne,"Pet fur sheds ubiquitously anywhere the dog goes, in shedding breeds -- there are seasons where it's elevated for certain dogs, but this cannot be predicted and shedding never stops, just slows. Non-shedding breeds still can trigger allergies by leaving saliva on surfaces (although the risk doesn't last for long, if I had to guess, though an allergist would have to pipe up on that one), and anyway, shedding dogs are much more common than non-shedding breeds or crosses. Individuals who are sensitive to pet dander can be astoundingly sensitive to small amounts in the environment, and sometimes their reactions can be very serious."

Additionally, although more of a logistics issue, it's questionable if a formal education program could even be designed to equally help all groups' interests. Secondly, even if voters are ignorant, things might just be alright."

t3_2zgan1,cpisnyf,"It's more to do with a perception that they're all criminals, rather than Anglo-Irish politics.

I'm certainly not an expert on the subject."
t3_2yazrj,cp7vhe9,"edit: And looking over those years you linked, I recognize almost all of them. Well obviously there are going to be songs that we're not going to remember (although you linked a year that contained ""Hey Jude....""), but the 60s and the 70s were host to some drastic changes in music. What the most ""revolutionary"" thing we have today?"

I don't dislike him just because he beat Rihanna half to death, although I think it's perfectly valid to lose respect for someone forever for that. I dislike him because he continually shows that he's a violent man with serious anger issues that he doesn't seem to care."
t3_2wc5yt,copid03,"In terms of the Sherpas, I've actually done many years of work with indigenous populations in some of the absolute poorest places in the U.S. and I can tell you that while it may seem exploitative, for instance, for Native Americans to sell drums, pipe bags, feathers, and other trinkets to tourists (because it is both perpetuates misrepresentations of their actual culture and because it exploits and takes advantage of spiritual traditions which have already been significant casualties of war), surprisingly most of the people I've spoken to would still rather not have that small source of income disappear. I find myself wondering if this is not also the case (although arguably to a much greater degree) for those Sherpas who, if not for the income related to acting as guides, might find themselves displaced entirely, losing what is left of their way of life. Should they not at least be allowed the option about whether or not they choose to participate in a risky endeavor in order to preserve their way of life?"
t3_2uyc2l,codgr1k,"We were taught how to apply dental dams and female condoms. We talked about masturbation, and even about sex toys, although without much detail. No one of these things was emphasized more than the other, which made all of them equally ""normal"" or ""acceptable""."

They contend that although the fetus relies on the mother completely in order to grow into a child, it is equally ethically abhorrent to terminate the life in its gestation period as it is to terminate it after it has been born. The reason they refuse to accept non-life threatening reasons as valid grounds for an abortion is because they view the process as putting economic/emotional/etc strain over the value of a human life."
