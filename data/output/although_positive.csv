t3_2pkvb6,cmxr4yg,Pain is a physical and mental response to trauma although when you're feeling it pain takes on nuance.
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Thank you although I think the argument accomplishes both.
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Yes although I can only answer based on my personal experience.
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,We have total agency from an existential point of view although reality does assert itself early and often.
t3_2p19c2,cmsmj84,"Without going into it comprehensively, although it is very difficult to get complete numbers, here is a reasonable article about the number of people who are wrongfully killed by police in a year: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/ So, because there isn't great evidence, unless you have better evidence, I think it is safe to assume that this is accurate info."
t3_2l6s0m,cls56tt,"My interest, although not yet my career, is marine biology, so I will look at this subject from an oceanographic point of view."
t3_2l6s0m,cls56tt,"The #1 concern for me is[ ocean acidification,](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F) which is happening now and everywhere, although most noticeably in my area of the world (Puget Sound, PNW)."
t3_2hxjbt,ckx4axr,"The Four Horsemen and Horsewoman generally defined atheism as being without belief, although Hitchens and HArris were particular fans of New Atheism, which wrapped rationalism and skepticism into the mix with atheism."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrirh7,"In terms of athleticism, everyone knows how exhausting it is to box (some professional boxers burn more calories than a professional footballer per hour (although this is more debatable))."
t3_2g4ifu,ckfqk9u,"I used to agree with you fully on this, as what I really want out of eating wings is threefold: Moist chicken meat
 Flavourful(usually spicy) sauce * A satisfying exterior(smooth for wet wings, crisp or breaded for dry wings) I had always found eating bone-in wings to be quite unavailing as although they very well encapsulated my three desires of chicken wings, eating them was too: messy, costly and time consuming."
t3_2g4ifu,ckfqk9u,"I thusly turned to bone-out or boneless wings to satisfy my chicken based cravings, which although satisfying, often fell a bit short of the standard imposed by the bone-in wing."
t3_2fuvyn,ckd2th4,"Of these three, only C seems potentially dangerous to me, although (of course) people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C. Now if A (one life-partner) is fine without C, then B must be pretty harmless without C, as well... if you do all your sexual experimentation with one partner, you are going to end up in pretty much the same place eventually, whether you start in the back seat of your parents' car or the bridal suite."
t3_2e4crb,cjvy9v7,"While I would accept that it could mean any of these things, I'd argue it's not incontrovertibly true that it does mean any of them in particular (although I would suspect that to many, defense from foreign invasion would be the concern that would trump all others)."
t3_2dtng7,cjt0gp1,"Therefore, you can have an omniscient God who doesn't know what I'm going to do way before I do it, although he would know what I've done as soon as I do it."
t3_2d80rd,cjn0zyz,"""Tried to domesticate you"" and ""You don't need no papers"" seem like she is separated but not divorced, although it could just be that he's comparing her to an animal and saying she doesn't need ""papers"" meaning a pedigree ... which is still gross."
t3_2cfco7,cjf04a9,"I am female, and although I have an irregular cycle, I do ovulate and could have children one day."
t3_2b3lad,cj1iybx,"Also, although the salary of the President isn't that amazing, the perks are ridiculous, and opportunity to make money after the job is over is better than for 99% of athletes."
t3_2b39o5,cj1ixk2,"Wanting to play a game before buying it is a separate desire from wanting to play a demo; and although there is some overlap between the two, demos are different from the final game."
t3_2b39o5,cj1jj7u,"What I am getting at is although you insist it is the lack of a demo that pushes you to piracy, it i instead the lack of a way to experience the game prior to purchasing it."
t3_2b39o5,cj1jj7u,"I'm well aware 50% + of this thread has been trying to convince you of the merits of onlive video/text review, and I understand that although they believe these methods to work for them personally, they do not in fact work for you."
t3_2a7f52,cisbwf3,In many ways I think 11's first episode is a better starting point and not much is lost by starting there although it would be necessary to go back through 9 and 10 for the 50th special to make sense.
t3_2a2ccx,ciqt1fb,"In fact, although those phone calls annoy me as well, I think they can be a very helpful political advertising tool."
t3_29pjwk,cincqfj,"the problem here is a simple one of equivocation the primary issue is that ""authority"" in the common sense consists of people who have the capability to lie induction is based on independently confirmed observations over the course of as many trials as possible so far, we pretty much know that gravity is gravity because so far, while on the ground on planet earth, we have not observed an apple falling up a person who is considered an ""authority"" can say he's seen an apple falling up, and that's quite a different matter than whether or not apples actually fall up on a regular basis and that this fact could be independently observed and confirmed by multiple parties in multiple trials across the planet while it's entirely possible that one person may lie about apples falling up, it becomes (usually) increasingly more and more unlikely that people are lying when multiple independent sources attempt and observe the same phenomena when subject to a panel of people (peer review) who usually by and large would like nothing more than to prove someone else wrong science is self correcting... when ""I tried it a thousand times at a hundred spots across the globe and so far apples don't fall up, so I think you're full of shit"" is the response that comes from dozens or hundreds of different people, you can be fairly (although of course not 100%) assured that apples do not fall up and that gravity behaves as we more or less expect of course you are free to believe that apples fall up based on the evidence that there is a logical fallacy known as the appeal to authority and that you are effectively taking these people's word on the situation and so hundreds of people may be involved in a mass conspiracy to delude you - but I'd pretty much say that's at the very least counter productive, and at the worst kind of stupid in fact you are welcome to try your own experiments to let go of apples and see how many of them fall upwards (pending approval of funding of course), but my guess is that you will observe that they do not fall up and that if you do observe that they fall up there is one of several explanations, either you may have indeed found an anomaly (the least likely) or you are on drugs, or you simply have confirmation bias - and confirmation bias is a primary reason that things like peer review exist, because a person like yourself might not believe the status quo and may wish to try for themselves, and you are welcome to do so, and if you can provide a way for other people to also challenge the theory as you did, and also do the thing, and also see the same results, then maybe you've found an anomaly otherwise you're just crazy - of course you may simply be narcissistic and think that other people are not real or some such other oddity and so their challenges and retesting of the experiments don't count because they're all out to pull the wool over your eyes, but that would basically be psychosis if I've got my terms correct, and you would in that case be suffering from an equally problematic situation in which you think you are, but you are not, an authority"

t3_26z994,ci473oh,"The reason I 'encourage this fear' is that, although the sense that I was/am small 'prey' starting developing in my late teens, it didn't actually hit home until after I was sexually assaulted."
t3_26klj1,chs24pt,I do not substantially disagree with your main point (although your take on it seems a bit negative to me).
t3_26b7qy,chpe7k0,"It worked well for Reagan's years even with his enormous Cold War spending, although I'm ill-equipped to argue that it'd work for us now."
t3_24uvqn,chbpy2d,"Maybe instead of pushing for earlier human testing you should be thinking pharmaceutical companies should be made more aware that animal models aren't necessarily accurate so they shouldn't ditch drugs that cause non-fatal side effect, especially if the drug shows exceptional promise in treating the disease (although I wouldn't be surprised if this was already the case)"

t3_21ssfi,cgg9yzd,"Tons of fantastic things going for China, but, to horribly simplify an aspect of the problem and dial up the contrast to 11 to get the issue across quickly: If one person creates X, and two people in the next door house copy X from their neighbour (without even payment to their neighbour), then although the GDP of the house with 2 people appears to be greater..."
t3_21rsdj,cgg2pxh,"Wikipedia is alright, although pretty dry."
t3_21rsdj,cgfwsxp,"If you like fiction, you are made to imagine scenarios and completely different characters which is much more stimulating than watching a movie where the whole imaginative 'work' is done for you (although I am a huge fan of LOTR, both books and films, nut that's beyond the point)."
t3_20iv9v,cg3y5m7,"I have no problem in concept with the idea of Crimea choosing to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, although I think that they should also allow sub-regions of Crimea to secede from Crimea."

t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine."

t3_1rw7vg,cdrov9y,"Late to the party so not sure if anyone will see this: I think the real reason why we use the word ""Feminism"" is because we acknowledge that, although this is at heart an equality movement, many women are suffering to a much greater degree than men - and thus it is women that need to find a rallying ground in order to tackle their problems."

t3_1ioyfw,cb6negu,"I consulted the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of their definitions of the word 'they' is: I think it can sound perfectly fine in certain sentences, for example: ''If someone knocks on the door, ask them to wait'' or ''You can bring a friend and they can share our picnic'' So although it does sound awkward in some circumstances, it's actually grammatically correct"

t3_1fl5d8,cabci41,"It is your contention that in some sense Mendel was not 'honest' to other scientists because his groundbreaking work on genetics was carried out in a church, although quite what you believe a scientist must do to be 'honest' is not made clear - in the scientific method it literally doesn't matter whether the results you publish come to you in an LSD-induced hallucination as long as they are replicable by others, so how can it possibly matter whether your beliefs are coherent?"
