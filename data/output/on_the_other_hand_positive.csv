t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"Science is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore the relationships between things in the world. Philosophy, on the other hand, is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore reasoning . You call on science when you need to answer questions about how the world works, and you call on philosophers when you need to know about how to reason correctly in unfamiliar conceptual territory."
t3_2ox2nh,cmrepwp,"The OS X users have every major and minor software update for free The problem with the Surface is that it is a pretty new product and will probably go through some sort of mid-life crisis and change too many things people won't like (as Microsoft is showing spectacularly everywhere else). Macs on the other hand, have gone through 30 years of product adjusting and cycling and know what will appeal to the vast majority of the population. "
t3_2nycpk,cmi0pj8,"yes, some planning skills are needed but if you work well under pressure and can pump out quality in those conditions, embrace it rather than fight it. laziness, on the other hand, is neural and physical atrophy. "
t3_2mesct,cm3nquu,"Some people (even though they are a visibly smaller group) really just enjoy this initial buildup. - Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. It's different."
t3_2lqcby,clx7ex2,"So a noise ordinance is totally neutral as to your speech, and only regulates decibels. This on the other hand restricts speech based on content. If you can ticket the guy who says hey baby, but not the guy who says ""Jesus saves!"
t3_2k08pw,clgrnar,"They tend to have fewer kids and to have them later because there are other areas in which they can find fulfillment. If, on the other hand, you make raising children the one fulfilling activity for an entire half of your population, they're going to have more children. Not because they're wired to want children or any sexist nonsense like that, but just simply because it's all their society will let them do."
t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"In other words, it is a pure public good because it is non-rival and non-excludable (in fact, it is the best, and some would say only good example of a pure public good). The healthcare system, on the other hand, can be provided for by private organizations. There are, of course, reasons that the level of healthcare provided by the private market is too low or the prices are too high, but it can be provided for on some level."
t3_2i53gm,ckz0h04,"One day his lens hood hit something and it left a little nick in the hood, the camera was still fine but it is a tiny eyesore that made him quite sad as it was pretty new and it cost him all of his savings to buy it, and he doesn't have the money to buy a new lens hood. I, on the other hand, dropped mine down a hill and could just be happy that it was still working, as I did not have nearly as much invested in my camera as my brother has in his, because if it was broken I don't have to save up for a year to get a new one. "
t3_2giql7,ckm2t5e,"Women have an inherent value by the virtue of having a womb. Men on the other hand, have to make value, by acquiring wealth and having career(so that they can provide a good life to the woman for her baby). BUT, we now live in the world where women are not reliant upon men, and they are not defined purely based on their 'intrinsic value' of having a womb."
t3_2f8s0s,ck7d64v,"I consider this ""preventative"" in terms of poverty. Welfare, on the other hand, merely funds those in poverty and doesn't really provide a way out more than it does a way to sustain a poor life. So, when I discuss welfare, I see welfare as merely funding the result of a problem."
t3_2dzrhq,cjunv4h,"The protest seems completely valid to me, because it's not just for MB but also for all of victims of police brutality... The rioting/looting on the other hand - that's a different story (but that's mostly out of towners). "
t3_2cfco7,cjexmb9,"She would be able to make life choices using that knowledge. Your wife, on the other hand, has been dreaming of having multiple babies her entire life. If someone told me that I couldn't have more than one baby, I would be crushed (*especially* if the first child was ill or a special-needs child)."
t3_28io13,cibhh0f,"Even so, I would have rather served one of the sweet black families than the frat tools any day of the week. (Demanding and entitled people on the other hand deserve a very special place in hell, but had I worked on the other side of town the demanding and entitled people would have been rich white housewives, so I certainly don't blame race on that.) Your servers appreciate your extremely generous tips when they get them, I'm sure."
t3_24v147,chbavh7,"It wasn't instantly reproduced. Modern narcissism, on the other hand, takes only the push of a button to be apparent. It only takes one finger for a selfie to be taken, for that selfie to be uploaded onto the internet, for that selfie to be liked and shared and commented upon."
t3_24svid,chabtmq,"Nah. Incest, on the other hand, is objectively more problematic. The incest taboo is near universal in a way that the same-sex/poly relationships aren't."
t3_235swt,cgu67oh,"He can also afford having fire alarm in every room of his mansion. Poor Jim on the other hand, might require less healthcare by being more responsible about his health. Since he's poor he cares about not paying for healthcare he won't use."
t3_21rsdj,cgfwfz1,"Some books are like martial arts charlatans -- they purport to have great new ideas, but most of it's just bullshido. A good nonfiction title, on the other hand, can expose you to a giant box of new ideas -- sometimes, ideas you may not understand or be ready for. \* - Note that while you may skip the reading and still get the grades, you're better-served by lighting your tuition money on fire to cook bacon if you do so."
t3_1we3gg,cf15n2w,"In short, if you are ok with genetic testing and will abort if there is an issue and/or you have a condition where the penetration of the disease process is potentially low (up for debate what this # is by the way), then it's a calculated risk that you can skew in your favor and is not necessarily unreasonable. If on the other hand you don't believe in abortion or genetic testing, then this particular argument won't hold any water. 2) other effects of genes - This is best explained via sickle cell disease."
t3_1vrpkb,cev5jso,"This self insurance works because a bad ingot is a small risk. Farmers, on the other hand, need crop insurance. A single crop failure can make a small farm unable to pay their bills for a year, through no real fault of the famers."
t3_1t8yrt,ce5s1ev,"However, there are some important points: The categorical imperative only works when applied to maxims , big life-guiding principles, and not to individual actions. For example, the imperative could be misused to say, that if you have three children, that's immoral by leading to overpopulation, on the other hand, if you have two children, then it would lead to extermination if everyone else following your example, (when factoring in accidents and infertilitly and illness). So everyone is morally expected to have 2.085 children."
t3_1q0s26,cd87o5o,"If, every time I called you, AND if you happened to start with ""3"" instead of some other number, that you always gave the same sequence of numbers afterwards, you would be pseudorandom instead of random. If, on the other hand, at least one of the following numbers were different, you would be random instead of pseudorandom. What happens in that case instead is that the sequence of numbers you give me is highly ""autocorrelated,"" where your previous answers bias your next answer."
t3_1ppyu1,cd4tc4n,"Cersei is clearly on the side of this game, she is even the one who actually says the phrase. Ned Stark, on the other hand, has no interest in the throne. He, along with his children, have no designs on it."
t3_1onshz,cctslvq,"This is because alcohol becomes toxic if you ingest about six-times the intoxicating dose. Marijuana, on the other hand, has the toxic dose estimated at about 10,000 times the intoxicating dose. (*Illegal Drugs*, Paul Gahlinger)."
t3_1oe5hc,ccr69ni,"A major difference between these two categories is that anything can become illegal if the right people put it into writing and there are people willing to enforce it. What's moral, on the other hand, is much more rigid, maybe even set in stone. It can't just be changed by the stroke of the pen."
t3_1lkxku,cc0nc73,"is a highly trained, highly skilled craftsperson working in very favorable conditions, doing something they can be very proud of, and are paid well. Toyota, on the other hand, is well-known to use close to slave labor for some of their production. Part of the cost of a high end luxury car is paying and treating people well."
t3_1khlm7,cbp1ln5,"100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return URL of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient."
t3_1jaqjx,cbctgfc,"With a poorer person, especially the very poor, much of that X% is taken from living expenses, and they have to live with less necessities, less quality ones, and simply live with less. With someone with more money on the other hand, the money that is taken is coming nigh 100% from luxury expenses. You will never need to cut back on anything that you actually need, or anything that you desire to be comfortable (air conditioning, home ownership, utilities, etc), while someone else might."
t3_1inwvh,cb6bomz,Orientation is the same as gender or race in that you have no choice in what cards you were dealt. Prejudices on the other hand are a choice. 
t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"We know this is isn't a deeply ingrained behavior; even among large African felines, some are social, some aren't. I'm pretty sure there isn't a single ""form groups"" gene; on the other hand, I'm pretty sure there is some genetic basis that leads to the behavior. We can express the idea of forming groups culturally, and wrap some words and titles around it (tribe, chief) - is it then a meme?"
t3_1hf3eh,catuwc7,"That's a pretty wide distribution of power. Corporations on the other hand allow anyone with money, regardless of citizenship status, felony status, or age to participate in the results of the corporation (goods and services) at any time, as many times as they want, with as much volume as they want, limited by their available funds. Additionally, public corporations allow anyone from anywhere to obtain voting rights with regard to the direction of any corporation in proportion to the amount of money they have relative to others participating."
t3_1h5bo4,car3t1w,"Race, for example, always triggers strict scrutiny. Gender, on the other hand, only warrants intermediate scrutiny, though it has gotten to the point in some cases where it's closer to strict than anything. Age and disability trigger deferential scrutiny."
t3_1gndd7,calw2lu,"It's a tool at your disposal, both to entertain and exercise your brain as to allow one to see the difference between what is part of and necessary to our default state. That's not an unreasonable position to hold, but on the other hand it's completely acceptable for someone not to agree or only agree to a certain point. I do agree that materialism is the default position, but not because no contrary evidence is shown."
t3_1ghq26,cakd83v,"So usually a bit older, but not too old. The guys, on the other hand, will look for women around whom they can take on this confident and slightly dominant role. Guys tend to feel out of their element around women who outsmart them and out-achieve them, and tend not to be comfortable in a relationship like that."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"Ireland, however, does accept arguments made on a religious basis as over 80% of it's population is Catholic. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is not a secular state as the monarch derives her authority from God (hence ""God and my right""). So the secularism of a state is in no way linked to the kinds of laws they make regarding religious freedoms (the UK and Iran are not secular states that take vastly different approaches to religious freedoms)."
t3_1f9oa8,ca8i7gl,"When we can recognize that life as human is a different story -- almost certainly somewhere between 5 and 24 weeks. Something that doesn't have a spinal cord, heart or brain cannot remotely be called human; on the other hand, once it can survive out of the womb it's hard to argue that it's not a person. I don't think that's very apparent at all."
t3_1cymw8,c9l9z8j,"More than even that, though, is that a belief in hell gives you the comfort of knowing that even if someone who does great evil in this life gets away without corporeal punishment, God will not let them get away without any punishment. Atheism, on the other hand, takes away all of that. To an atheist who does not believe in an afterlife everyone is equal in death."
t3_1c8ym3,c9e9ga5,"Our version of equality is awesome!"" but on the other hand they're all, fucking, obnoxious children who need to re-prioritize their lives. For the most part they're URL ."
t3_33ltmy,cqm5qxx,"The reason I'm asking is this: a lot of people in that job will choose to find devious ways to skirt them. If, on the other hand, you go into the job choosing to help the company abide by them - and if you think your bosses would accept that and give you the space to do it - then, by taking this job, you are helping the environment, because you're helping ensure that one company is abiding by the rules rather than finding creative ways to skirt. It's a small victory."
t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"For instance, oil-rich countries today may have a GDP of a billion zillion dollars, but once they run out of oil or oil prices crash, so does their GDP. Economic well-being, on the other hand, is meant to reflect an economy that can be reasonably resilient to the things life throws at it - a diversified economy governed by stable institutions. We believe that robust sources of revenue are manufactured goods, technological innovation, human and institutional capital, so on - and we try to track for those with measures like HDI."
t3_30bmbr,cpqwrqy,piaget's developement system. http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/child-development/piaget/ on the other hand young people learning a second language is a really really good idea since learning it at this stage is much easier. IT: coding has the same abstract thought problems that philosophy shares and you really don't need to teach tech to them so early.
t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"People in situation -1- obviously don't need to be encouraged to integrate. People in situation -2-, on the other hand, need to ask hard questions: why is it that Country A, your native country whose culture is familiar and comfortable, is so shitty that you left behind everything to start over somewhere else, whereas Country B, the new country whose culture seems unfamiliar and ugly, is so amazing that you chose to live here rather than your native land? In some cases the shittiness of Country A relates to economics."
t3_2y1nt3,cp5nc7k,"If your position is something like ""The dirty proletarians will all be baristas and janitors, they don't need any fancy book larnin',"" then I don't agree but I can see why many of my examples would affect you. If, on the other hand, you don't think most people will win the nobel prize but you do think most people should be educated to a level that would permit them to understand public policy and current events, pursue their academic interests, and aspire to a broad variety of professional paths, then (a) there are a large variety of applications where being able to translate a conceptual problem into an algebraic problem is important, and (b) there are harder and harder levels of math which rely on algebra just as heavily as algebra relies on arithmetic. The point of the example wasn't specifically about the relationship between the expression ""6x5"" and the conclusion that x=-15."
t3_2xcu0u,coyz7wp,"Any effect they have on you is completely voluntary, and you have the right to completely disassociate with them any time you like. Governments, on the other hand, do not afford you that liberty. When the government says something, you have no choice."
t3_2vxd18,com8usv,Not just GM's but the actual players can look at their stats and compare them to the contracts of other players in their respective fields to boost their payroll. Doctors on the other hand do not fully understand where they lie on the scale of top ranked doctors in the world and aren't able to negotiate their contracts to match what other doctors make. Another element comes from athlete having more leverage on a team then citizens at their jobs.
