t3_2rkzen,cngvxsd,"Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this. What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed? Also, only one of my parents finished high school."
t3_2rexe3,cnf8xlt,"On a personal level, though, I agree that ""military discount"" becoming ""public service discount"" wouldn't be a bad idea. It should be noted, however, that this would extend to even people like politicians, teachers, and government administrators "
t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over. It's this aspect that attracts the people you describe, the site however doesn't create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself, helps them get out of that mindset in their real life. I've been browsing that site for 10 years, and arguably i'm more optimistic and positive because i've been exposed to that raw humanity."
t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"Further more sexual immorality is explicitly condemned, in the context of homosexuality among other things as being part of this. This is the more pressing issue however- the Church likely would never consider a person to ever be any gender than the one God made them. Or in other words, it would be condemned as homosexuality, becuase you cannot change the gender that God gave you."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"I'd make a side point here that many early 90's genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition, and that's often for artists/styles that are effectively dead and gone (re: nirvana). Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad. Still, though, Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre, and there's a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and much of the mainstream ilk out there."
t3_2pmtj8,cmy67dn,"I would agree that the movie industry is stagnating. It is less about creative ability and much more about making money, however, that is an argument for another post. The argument that I have in response to your post is that as most movies become more generic in an attempt to pull in a more general audience (and make more money), more indie and less mainstream movies are easier to find and more important to the movie culture as a whole now."
t3_2p13uo,cmse4ly,"Namely, an attempt to inflict the punishment is in fact less severe than actually being able to inflict said punishment, so the equality in 4 does not hold. Points 1, 2, and 4 are valid; however, a technicality concerning point 3 ruins this entire argument. Namely, an attempt to inflict the punishment is in fact less severe than actually being able to inflict said punishment, so the equality in 4 does not hold."
t3_2p04r0,cms4fca,"Your brain is functionally independent of other brains, and whatever opinion you hold in that brain cannot be extracted from it. Your arguments, however, are really about misunderstandings of that phrase rather than about the phenomenon itself. And they are wrong to do so."
t3_2orvv0,cmpxqmg,"You're somewhat correct in saying there's nothing objectively different between the two: neither are particularly harmful in cultures where they are accepted. We're talking about culture, however, and culture is best studied as the subjective construct that it is. Through our contemporary Western social lens, consent must be given for all moral sexual acts."
t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"If your point is that it is inaccurate to say she is objectively beautiful, then you're correct. Try to consider, however, that the people commenting on her beauty may be doing so in an effort to be compassionate. Although the situation might seem simple, there's actually quite a few factors involved that influence the response."
t3_2o0cgz,cmik258,"Especially if the guy keeping the chickens is using locally-sourced feed. I agree, however, it's small enough that I would wager you could make a bigger difference by simply being smarter about where you source your food. I have no math to back this up, but my bet is that buying cranberries from Maine has a bigger carbon footprint for me than having an egg or two from the chicken next door."
t3_2nzz4f,cmigfqh,"I don't disagree that it's a flaw in the system, simply that it's not a problem with grand juries. That actually often happens exactly like that in cases where there's a clear conflict of interest, however, it is often up to the parties involved to be honest about their bias. I don't disagree that it's a flaw in the system, simply that it's not a problem with grand juries."
t3_2njpov,cme8uee,"Probable cause really isn't a difficult standard to meet. Beyond reasonable doubt, however, is much more difficult. In other words, if the Grand Jury determines that probable cause cannot be met, then beyond reasonable doubt cannot be met either."
t3_2nbeuf,cmcdl7k,"There's always that. Your individual life becomes meaningful (potentially) in this: you know that all of your actions can and will have an impact and will create a ripple, however great or small. Like it or not, you are changing the course of history, even just submitting this question to reddit."
t3_2m34jb,cm0licf,"But nor are we meant to be polyamorous, or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are, however, able to do all of those things. That said, you're all over the place."
t3_2kuu7n,clp4w50,If you tried to cap company profits you would only be encouraging companies to play games with their revenues in order to ensure they fell under that cap. You would not cause them to change their fundamental business practices however. There are a lot of people (some very smart ones included) who think you can simply change the world by fiat - you cannot.
t3_2kko3q,clmg3b8,"I want to argue that democracy is not always the best choice in every situation, in particular the number of times where a democracy fails is very large. In established states or states with little internal tensions democracy functions well - however in highly heterogenous and divided states or states with strong foreign interests it fails: in recent times: libya egypt iraq afghanistan zimbabwe ukraine thailand historically you can consider: the weimar republic any of the french republics in the first 70 years after the revolution the first polish republic a badly set up democracy is often worse than a good dictatorship, and arguably Franco and Pinochet were better off for their countries at the time than the free choice of the people . Likewise right now in Syria a democracy could well entrench IS."
t3_2kfldi,clkuur6,"It's actually fair criticism. What is dangerous however is what people who cry ""islamophobe"" are doing because by saying that fair criticism is bigotry, they are censoring it, and letting these disgusting human rights violations continue. "
t3_2kacra,cljftmb,"Men and women doing the same job for the same company probably do make very similar wages. The issue, however, becomes apparent over long stretches of time and large sample sizes. Edit: Very sorry if my original wording was confusing or inadequate."
t3_2kacra,cljftmb,"Basically, according to the US Department of Labor: For further sources, please see: http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/31/cmi-equal-pay-report http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf http://social.dol.gov/blog/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/ I very much understand that there are flaws with the ""77 cents"" figure (as with any point of data). I still firmly hold, however, that whether we want to say that the wage gap is 77%, 90% or even 99.9%, that is an issue that needs to be systemically corrected. "
t3_2k6r90,clih2os,"It's tempting to want to agree with you, for the simple reason that we do indeed come out on top in most measurements of happiness, wealth, and a number of other statistics. There are some frequently cited drawbacks, however: 1. The ""Jante Law"" culture, which is a variant of the ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"", where excellence is actively discouraged."
t3_2k4hym,clhtpwj,"Golf drive distance, which can make a pretty huge difference, is also highly influenced by your core strength, height, and general physique. Golf and archery are characterized by the fact that in between shots/strokes, you're generally either sitting or walking, however, this does not change the amount of physical ability and acuity you need when you ARE shooting or taking a swing. As a small 5'1"" female, I can usually expect a drive distance of around 100ish yards."
t3_2k3k0f,clhk37s,"Many feminists will advocate for equality, for trans rights, to address male victims of sexual assault or domestic violence. Feminism itself, however, is a movement with a more specific aim. It is a movement that fights for equality by demanding more rights to go towards a historically victimized group, much in the way that civil rights leaders in the 1960s up to today acted."
t3_2k1utj,clh4t7a,"What all of these things have in common is that if you do them with someone you're in love with and care deeply about, the act takes on a greater meaning and value, because you're doing it with that person, and that means something to you. The fact that you can have those events be an intimate experience does not mean, however, that that's all they can be. I've gone to dinner with anything from acquaintances, to friends, to people I was in a relationship with, and it's different based on who it's with."
t3_2jp9x4,clekeze,"the understanding is that the work being done is worth an equivalent amount within that relationship. This isn't necessarily the case however: there are some situations where one partner is rich, the other beautiful, and they most certainly are not contributing equally to the relationship. I am not saying you are wrong - I am saying you are not right."
t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"There are, of course, reasons that the level of healthcare provided by the private market is too low or the prices are too high, but it can be provided for on some level. Because of the inefficiencies of the market, however, it can be worthwhile for the government to step in, and create a public system on some level. Because it is the government entering into an otherwise private market, that's essentially what socialism, by most definitions is."
t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"Because it is the government entering into an otherwise private market, that's essentially what socialism, by most definitions is. The military, however, would never have a private market, so it doesn't fit that definition. The debate over how much the government should spend on the military is a completely different issue from how socialist it is."
t3_2izt1m,cl7sekd,"Not even Ron Paul would say that. It will however, prevent escalation of various crises. You say that you're abandoning non-interventionism, so a point that I'll keep reiterating is that non-interventionism is a more realistic and better foreign policy than interventionism."
t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,"Interestingly enough some scientists have tried comming up with a definition of life for, of all things, space exploration. Their concepts have application for all biology however. I will note that there is some disagreement about these definitions but nevertheless they serve as a great/solid foudation upon which to build our ideas of life."
t3_2isiv7,cl525xl,However if we do have immigrants who for some reason want to permanently reside in the country but are incapable of passing a test on civics I do not think it is appropriate to give them the vote. This however would be a very rare case as people allowed to immigrate should be more than intelligent enough to pass the citizenship test. On the other hand there would be a large number of natural born residents who cannot pass a citizenship test.
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"But, more importantly I don't think we could ever come close and that this is more akin to fantasy than reality. Secondly, it ignores that however small, there is some degree to which race, as a concept, is scientific . Radiolab did an excellent episode on this; while 'race' isn't a thing per se, someone's ancestry and the traits passed on therefrom can actually be read in our DNA."
t3_2iht9m,cl2lqsw,"Highly stressful, highly depressing situation. Now, I couldn't find any particular statistics on chef based suicides, however a quick google search will yield a higher amount of both drug and alcohol abuse among the cooking profession, which needless to say can lead to depression. Factor in the environment of higher end cooks (such as drug laden vegas) and suddenly the picture is a little more clear."
t3_2i4ujn,ckz1of3,"We can't know somebody had sex and predict it could lead to a holocaust. We can, however, look at Mein Kampf and predict that this sort of thinking, in power, could be very harmful. The same is true of Islam."
t3_2h0jzj,ckohl81,"It's not ""not all Christians"" it is that ""essentially no Christians"". And however rare fundamentalists are, atheists are rarer. The ""cure"" is far worse than the disease."
t3_2gpr0w,cklgr3p,"Definitions are arbitrary, so let's restate the question. Do you think there is something ""wrong"" or not justified about a person saying that they are afraid of death, or taking actions to avoid death (or however fear translates into action)? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY seems somehow relevant to this conversation--be warned, it contains spoilers for 2001: A Space Odyssey."
t3_2gi67o,ckkjw7q,"OJ for example was acquitted at the criminal trial because there was reasonable doubt. He was however, convicted in civil court because by a balance of probabilities. This happens all the time."
t3_2gi67o,ckkjw7q,"You have no protected right to attend that school or spend time on my property. You do however have a protected right to physical freedom, which is why the criminal standard is so high. I however, don't need to be a criminal court to kick you out of my home or determine who can take part in a private entity."

t3_2fdmwl,ck87ud9,"The piece in itself is most likely mediocre, the history and process behind it is what matters to them. That's true for basically any form of art however. Art is never useful in itself."
t3_2f5k1m,ck66ybf,"Thus, it would be my opinion that, while we can all look at Jennifer Lawrence's tits without her consent, we are dicks for doing so. I am not sure this is off topic, however. I understand that you are making a judgment based upon the intent of the person affected by the leak."
t3_2f5k1m,ck65dhm,"If all your doing is looking it's not going to have a huge impact. If, however, people are visiting TMZ or publicly heralding the hacker for his ""great work"" or as is happening in some cases, people are actually donating to his bitcoin fund, then not only are you providing traffic and viewing figures but you're also contributing to the culture that makes this an acceptable way to behave. Yes, the cat is out of the bag in terms of people being able to see it, but every positive comment further cements the idea that this is okay to do because these people are famous."
t3_2eez7x,cjzf2j8,"The CMV talks about serious relationships, not marriage. If we talk about marriage in this context, I happen to agree; however, the prompt said relationships. Additionally, the statistic cited about divorce can be applied to any woman without a degree."
t3_2e4crb,cjxll0p,"Even if the people of, say Georgia, disagree with a national decision their soldiers are ordered to go along with it. The Georgia Militia however could do what it likes. It all comes down to the big fear of the time, which was big government."
t3_2e2jug,cjvwam2,"It's frankly quite shocking that we are able to come to some medium of consensus given America's disparate population composition. I think you are on the right track, however, you have failed to highlight the source of the problem. An ill-informed populace is only a symptom of the disease--a poor education system."
t3_2e1fah,cjv53s3,"Concerning the rural lifestyle: I would argue that a rural lifestyle is generally more boring than a suburban lifestyle. In a suburb, a car may be necessary to reach certain places; however, in a rural area, some of these places may be entirely inaccessible in the first place. Also, your experience of the rural lifestyle seems rather romanticized, or perhaps isolated from the more probable experience."
t3_2dzrhq,cjunv4h,"However, an anger has been building nationwide (again, with other examples) and when folks found out an unarmed kid was shot six times , twice in the head, things tipped. I'm sure the cop only had a second to react, and wasn't a psycho serial killer, however at the end of the day Michael was unarmed. The protest seems completely valid to me, because it's not just for MB but also for all of victims of police brutality..."
t3_2dw5ig,cjtn82k,"It depends, (in the US) if you aren't in the left most lane, then you're right. If you're in the left-most lane, however, you should move over, even if you are passing yourself. Or move over once you finish passing."
t3_2dsd7q,cjsmz7i,"As well, the 9/11 victims may not have supported American actions in the Middle-East that would be one principle cause of the terrorist attack. If you argue however, the Gazans that deserve the Israel attacks are the ones that voted for Hamas specifically for the rhetoric about Israel, your argument may have more merit. But this would be abstracting the whole conflict into a 2-dimensional black/white debate."
t3_2dn11e,cjr2n9b,"You have every right to compare yourself to others, it's what we do. But however, it's sometimes wrong to compare ourselves to others in ways we know would not help us gain any insight about ourselves or learn anything. For example, I have an extreme dislike for anyone who compares me to my brother by pointing out my failings and glorifies his successes."
t3_2dgu6l,cjpdy8k,"In my experience there is a continuum in the computing world with Apple on one end and Linux on the other. With Apple, your options are limited as are you ability to fix things, however you don't have to do much of anything to get a standard config to work, but you really can't setup things in a nonstandard way. With Microsoft you have alot of options and a pretty good ability to fix things."
t3_2d7otc,cjmz9b7,"Once I lived on the second floor (or third, depending on how you count) of a building and one person was really annoyed when I took the elevator because I was ""only"" on the second floor. From my point of view, however - it seemed very arbitrary that I was not allowed to take the elevator to the second floor, and everyone should get off two floors below their floor and walk if I was expected to walk. Plus I took the elevator only when tired and I paid the same for the building amenities."
t3_2cixjs,cjfyd92,"So I guess it might be possible in that case. For that to happen, however, you'd need the AI to gain the ability to self-reprogram to accomplish task it was not specifically programmed to execute. But even then; why ?"
t3_2c3fc3,cjbjw5y,"You don't need to tell him to use deodorant, but, if it's distracting to the other students you could tell him he needs to keep his body odor in check. He could use baking soda or wash up a couple times a day, however he wants to manage it, but he really doesn't have the right to be a distraction and cause the whole environment to be uncomfortable for everyone else.

t3_2boe3r,cj7c5d5,"(I like Creepers.) When you have a female character, however, who is part of the plot, who has a name, and as such is not supposed to be considered an obstacle to victory, but instead an ally, she really ought to have some level of agency. Both sets of objectifications are crappy to me, and I'll turn off a game or film if there's too much of either."
t3_2bmble,cj6sflw,"That being said, if you are aiding a woman in an Arabic society who is fighting against her oppression, go ahead. If you are, however, trying to give ""help"" to people who never asked for it then you need to take a step back. For your second question, the answer is no, short of actual physical abuse taking place, you don't have a right to dictate how parents raise their children."
t3_2bdmlg,cj4r6pc,"Germany has just taken half of Poland. By your logic it wouldn't be our concern; however, the US could easily put a stop to it. Why not?"
t3_2ay3kf,cj0s4zc,"American english is used for most electronic devices because the majority of the products users will be american (Canada and the UK's populations combined is smaller than that of the US). I have however seen some products that give the option of Canadian/US/British english. All forms of english are derived from England, so if we wanna get technical about it, England is the initial source of the language and every other english dialect is derived from it."
t3_2axbu7,cizphk8,"For example, my mom believes that I should never compromise my beliefs and I should always make a stand for what I believe is right. My dad however, says there are times when it's okay to reason with people and to compromise if it could avoid unnecessary conflict. Lengthy story there just to say, many teenagers cannot put complete trust in what their parents say."
t3_2atkq9,ciyvkn0,"However, judging from your responses, I do not think you will find this line of reasoning convincing. I do agree, however, that the man's quip is a perfect example of verbal irony. I also disagree that the song is trying to allude to cosmic irony."
t3_2aotoi,cixcw5d,"If you're already pregnant, these will not help you at all. I.U.D.s are, however, one of the most effective forms of birth control on the market so if they really do want to decrease the number of abortions, not covering the most effective birth controls is really not the way to do so. Third, it's great that some people have the income to afford $50 for Plan B without filing for insurance."
t3_2ao6r9,cix76va,"One of the major issues that the modern establishment has with Updike is his narcissistic, misogynist viewpoint and yet you'll note the linked article only quotes male critics from any generation. I don't believe one needs to be a woman to note this issues in his writing, however, it does speak to another point: critics are not a perfect representation of the populous. The critical establishment has been very white, male, and upper-class for a long time, and celebrated and promoted authors of a similar mindset."
t3_2am3iw,ciwjejz,"I'm not going to try to convince you to not go. I am however going to try to convince you to look at it another way. In fact, I think going there and seeing the situation for yourself is probably the best thing you can do."
t3_2a7f52,cisdl2d,"I just don't really jive with them like most people do. Going by some of your responses, it sounds like you've only watched the 9th doctor episodes, which is understandable as that's where New Who begins, however most people, including myself, will say that the first season of the new show was among the weakest. In fact when recommending the show to new people, I usually say that you should start with season 3, aka right after Rose left the show and we're already well into the 10th doctor's era."
t3_2a49tn,cird475,"A lot of them. That doesn't dismiss the successes, however. You yourself point out that you've taken advantage of the system and you have bettered yourself."
t3_29pjwk,cinfrtq,"It possesses neither the particular characteristics of Capitalism, Communism or Socialism - it only possesses the commonality between these specific forms - and none of their differences. (I do however sympathise with the similarity you might be referencing. Since induction is reliant on past evidence, it can be said to be an ""appeal"" to the ""authority"" of that evidence."
t3_29oi1n,cimz15m,"The strategy is different after every play and needs to be constantly adjusted, rather than being mostly or completely decided before you ever set foot on the field. What I find most enjoyable about the NFL, however, is the sheer athletic prowess demonstrated. Most sports have a narrow range of body types that tend to do well at the sport, but football has a broad range."
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"Also if it's that unfettered to be with anyone that you deem worthy in your own eyes, and society were to stop judging people (as much as they do anyway) for their imperfect (and I'm not talking obese, cuz some things are still just bad/unhealthy etc and should not be condoned and no one should have to learn to like it) body images, that maybe more people would have more happiness in life and maybe relationships are actually quite a critically important health factor for the emotional wellbeing of the planet. The interesting thing for me is that I think I agree with all of your points and can't find a massively great specific rebuttal to almost any of them, however I have a general rebuttal. One thing I'd like to point out is that many if not most of the points you present seem to possibly imply that all relationships are or must be, by definition, monogamous."
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"Secondly, lets consider the situation of human happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment in the context of statistical analysis. I feel there is an artificial emphasis on romantic relationships presented to society by the media, however caveats come to mind. Humans are an explicitly social species, bears are not."
t3_28io13,cibhh0f,But not a single person stands out in my mind because they over tipped me. I do however remember a few faces of people that were extremely nice to me. I remember some smiles.
t3_28butd,ci9glxs,"My friends tell me I became super-paranoid and totally unaware of my surroundings. Most of it wore off after a week or two, some of the effects seem to have lasted much longer, however (paranoia, forgetting where I am and why). Overall I'd say it was one of the worst experiences of my life."
t3_27wog4,ci54b7y,"It's a frequent topic of discussion at /r/girlgamers. It seems, to me, that you're in something of a feedback loop because, however low the barriers to entry are for making games, the barriers are even lower to write about current games, and thus you're going to see more 'complaining' (a term seemingly reserved for women's grievances, rather than 'critique' or 'criticism' or 'review') than development. One occurs more low-key, in the background and over time."
t3_27dypa,ci0bdgm,"You are responsible for initiating sex with the other person, and the other person is equally responsible for reciprocating. This does not mean, however, that rape cannot happen when two people are drunk. It also does not mean that every time two people who are drunk have sex they are raping each other."
t3_2766rt,chxsyh1,"We can't judge god's actions or reasoning because we lack infinite perspective. This is probably the most solid answer that I am aware of; however, it kind of hoses the idea of God's Omnibenevolence in the first place... if he is ""Good"" but it is not a good that we can understand, why would we call him good at all? (Edit: Changed Omnibeneficant to Omnibenevolent as per the classic restatement."
t3_273kmd,chx2u1h,"I don't drink, even now, I also attempt not to socialize with people when I know they are going to be drinking in excess.. something that can be tricky when living in Australia and working in a very social company. And over the last decade, however, my views on this have completely flipped. It's important to remember that anyone spiking anyone's drink with anything for any reason is NEVER acceptable, and is likely a crime where you live."
t3_273kmd,chx2u1h,"You see, we should absolutely be treating alcohol and other drugs. The problem however isn't with how we view alcohol. It's with how we treat people who are addicts of other drugs."
t3_273kmd,chx2u1h,"Casual drug use, like casual alcohol use, can be absolutely fine when used in a sensible setting with people you know. We live in a society that is barely beginning to properly treat addictions in general, however alcoholism is probably the best understood and treated out there. While we could say that addiction tobacco is up there, we're increasingly treating it as if shaming and banning can ""protect people"" from their own choices."
t3_26z994,ci473oh,"It's not something I can teach to another woman or girl quickly. I can, however, simply tell her, ""Do not be alone with a man that has not earned your trust."" Be aware of your surroundings."
t3_25mebn,chimu8l,"But as you can hopefully see form my list, we very much still need feminism, and I think some people get very frustrated that this is still in doubt at all. I do present this style of argument any time I am asked, either online or offline, and yeah I do feel like I am definitely in the majority in terms of desires within feminism - however, the screaming crazy minority can unfortunately be louder than than majority sometimes and this makes things difficult for the more calm among us. "
t3_25gqr3,chh8rrt,"That's an intellectual possibility, but since neither science nor religion has anything to say about such a god, it warrants no further discussion. If however God has a plan for humanity, then He has either revealed it, or has not. Again, if the plan is unrevealed, then we're just meaninglessly taking our chances by any action we take."
t3_24c1q3,ch5zt5k,"The definition of Fetish, from Merriam-Webster: : a strong and unusual need or desire for something : a need or desire for an object, body part, or activity for sexual excitement From what you've said, your desire does not seem to be strong or necessary for your sexual excitement, so in the strictest sense of the word, you would not have a bush fetish. I do however agree that its odd that the level of grooming humans, and females in particular, partake in has reached this level. In response to the general discussion in this thread about the prevalence of women shaving, I (an American male) have found that it matters where you live."
t3_24c1q3,ch5zt5k,"Coastal regions, as per usual, seem to be the early adopters of a trend, and this is where you will observe the most females who engage in this behavior, whether its shaving it themselves, or getting a wax. In the South however, its still catching on (and I've never been to northern-central America). Mind you this evidence is purely anecdotal, and only from myself, but in CA and NY, every girl I slept with shaved, while in TX very few girls shave completely, most trim, and a few just let it grow."
t3_24bof3,ch5k4dl,"This is the nature of a first past the post election system (which we use in the US). In the long run, FPtP systems tend to become two party systems; however, if a third party jumps up one year, one of the big parties will either take their positions to win over more constituencies or one of the main parties will die out in favor of the new third party (closest example I can think of is the Whigs in 1860, but this is not a perfect example). So, very simply, a vote for a third party is usually worthless in the US because of our electoral system; however, if by chance a third party has a good year, you will see at least one party co-opt the ideas of it so that they can win over the people who did not vote for them."

If you heard just the drum track from the greatest hits of the last century (however you define them), you would probably recognize less than 5% of the songs. You would enjoy some of the drums, you'd recognize the songs where the drums lead the intro or chorus, but while listening to the full song you would almost never say ""I bet this drummer really knows his musical theory""."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"For example, the Republic of Ireland is a secular state because it's president is elected by the people and his power comes from a mandate bestowed upon him by the electorate. Ireland, however, does accept arguments made on a religious basis as over 80% of it's population is Catholic. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is not a secular state as the monarch derives her authority from God (hence ""God and my right"")."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"Syria for example, has been dominated by the Alawites since 1970.

They, at the very least, have the benefit of their own experiences to judge themselves from; you, however, want to step in and force them into neat boxes from the outside, boxes they themselves do not believe they fit. And classifying ""intersex"" as ""defect"" is just an easy way of ignoring the fact that physical sex is not neatly defined in nature; we are sexually dimorphic creatures, sure, but that carries with it the capability to develop as either gender (or a mix) depending on which hormones fire off when during our fetal development (or are you forgetting you have nipples, man?)."

t3_33x4zd,cqq3w8x,"In many cases all we know is that a hazard exists, but this is not necessarily a risk as we do not always know the most likely (or maximal) outcome, or how likely these outcomes are.
