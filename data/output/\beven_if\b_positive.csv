If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you ""should"" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged. It's not necessarily ""wrong"" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal."
t3_2rkzen,cngucgz,"Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test. This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing. The average IQ will still be measured in the same way, the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same."
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"You have to start somewhere, so to speak. Even if it's about the most insignificant of things, or even if they didn't change their mind at all, it's still a positive step for that person to try. Second, it sometimes goes the other way."
t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"I wrote all of this in all honesty not thinking anything would change your view based on your last sentence.

t3_2r1qfw,cnd3gva,"As can be seen in this thread, pretty everyone can be called a feminist. To take one of the more common examples: If you are for equality of women, you are a feminist, even if you call yourself an egalitarian, a humanitarin, a men's rights activist, a christian or whatever you want. Therefore, in order to be anti-feminism you need to want to have females be below males in some capacity."

t3_2q6x54,cn3lhe7,"Even most cisgender people get uncomfortable or offended if you misgender them. It would probably be best for your psychological health to identify as the gender you are most comfortable with, even if it's non-traditional. Besides this, you have a right to."
t3_2q4trg,cn2xhsb,"This defence directly and unavoidably engages that prejudice such that it is unlikely that a judge or jury will assess it reasonably and with the appropriately high bar in mind. And, even if some judges/juries would (and no doubt some would) it remains the case that it is incredibly difficult/impossible to tell in advance who would and it is further very difficult to change this sort of behaviour/prejudice. Lastly, the law in general, and the law of provocation defences in particular, play a normative role(The Alberta case URL explains why this question must have a normative dimension where-ever it is asked)."
t3_2q4trg,cn2zbxm,"You have to believe that trans people are so shocking that an ordinary person would be moved to homicidal violence by discovering that another person is transgendered. Further, even if there are circumstances where you believe this will apply the fact that you, and most other people believe the above things, and that many people believe worst things (including that trans-persons are dishonest, possibly sexually predacious, or at least sexually repulsive) makes me think that the necessarily extremely high standard for this defence will not be consistently respected by jurors. Lastly, the defence unavoidably relies on the legal fiction of the reasonable URL ."
t3_2q2cxc,cn28of2,"The chance of your machine being anywhere near the incredibly rare regeneration of a star would be miniscule. The universe as a whole would never restore itself to the point where one could be said to have survived and even if you did get lucky enough to be near a regenerated star once (and I'm talking about the star being part of your observable universe before it burns out), it wouldn't keep happening.

So, here's how it goes."
t3_2pata1,cmv1kvh,"Better job opportunities would provide me with more skills, experience, and money. If nothing else, hard work is required to maximize one's potential, even if you believe that potential is fixed from birth. Without hard work, one might get to, say, 65% of their potential."

Also, if you vote for a minority party, you may encourage the main parties to start to take up all of their policies, even if that minority party never get into power. Furthermore, voting isn't the only way to be political - you can join pressure groups, and be active politically in many other ways."
t3_2p0lop,cmsehsp,"ensuring good, agreed upon legislation is the point. even if it is good legislation, like your native american example, it is still unfair for anyone besides the majority of the pouplation to have such power in a majority-wins system. i mean, doesn't the notion of a minority having unfettered decision making power undermine the notion of majority rule, the point of direct democracy and everything you want in your system?"
t3_2oom50,cmp42jr,"Are you more looking for the mechanism by which power would induce corruption? Because even if we knew 100% that power actually directly corrupts people, it would be hard to show that without appealing to the notion that it just provided the means. For your stance to be true, it would require that all people, if given the same opportunity, would make the same choices regardless of the power they have."

t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"It has been a trend in the industry for a really long time to just have very flat female characters, and while maybe not the most mature or intelligent handling of the issue, I respect it for being an attempt that's reaching a wide audience. There are other examples in media that are doing the same thing better, like 500 Days of Summer or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but as far as books reaching a wide preteen and teen audience, I feel like John Green does a solid job at creating more multi-dimensional characters, even if they can still come off as generic and trope-y in their own ways.

t3_2o6paa,cmkar1d,"OP, I'm going to make a bold jump here, but please bear with me. Based on your starting argument, It sounds as though you understand some of the basic principles of evolution, and that you have an idea of how the scientific method works, even if you aren't yet willing to accept the conclusion that all species on Earth descended from a common ancestor. My assumption here (and please, correct me if I'm wrong) is that you are not yet willing to accept common ancestry because it directly conflicts with a core belief that you hold, which is to say that you believe that all species on Earth came to exist exactly as they are, through creation."
t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"She's showing a vulnerable moment and people empathize with her. Saying ""you're beautiful"" is another way of saying ""we care about you,"" even if it doesn't literally translate to that in the English language.

t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"Like I said, human imperfection is a fact of life. If a human following the very simple rules of pacifism, even if they know that sometimes it won't be perfect produces better results than trying to always do the perfect thing, then pacifism is absolutely a better ethical strategy. Its like if a hypothetical self-driving car has a known very low error rate."
t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"As for the ""relying on police officers"" and the like to ""do the dirty work"", I don't really understand that argument. The pacifist may oppose the actions of law enforcement, even if they result in their short term benefit. I would imagine an absolute pacifist would do everything in their power (short of violence, of course!)"
t3_2njpov,cme8uee,"In other words, if the Grand Jury determines that probable cause cannot be met, then beyond reasonable doubt cannot be met either. There is no guarantee of conviction even if the indictment is issued. ""Confusion"" in the testimony does not supersede the evidence."
t3_2nfgyu,cmdtb2g,"I don't know how to dispel this notion, but let's just leave alone for the moment that any proposal that requires officers to be videotaped in the bathroom, on the phone, at lunch, etc, will be dead on arrival. There's no way any union would agree to it, and even if it were forced through by fiat, it'd be overturned by the courts. Moving beyond that absurdity, we now need to address all the things that officers see and do that would be recorded."
t3_2nbeuf,cmc2wex,"No matter what else happens, even in the heat death of the universe when every particle has decayed and there's nothing left, nothing can change that you existed for a period of time.

The bad lawyer can screw things up even if the facts and law are on your side. It's much harder for the good lawyer to win despite really being wrong."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"The other guy was a few years ~3-4 older than me. The stuff that happened felt physically good, even if it made me feel sort of weird, or wrong inside. It was like stealing money from a friend's mum's purse and buying sweets for you and your friend, you knew it was a bad thing to do but your friend would act like you were really cool for doing it and the sweets tasted nice, so it was okay right?"
t3_2mm2dl,cm5j6hr,"He's sick like a dog with a deadly and easily transmittable disease. One that he can't afford a sick day for and even if he could, he can't afford to pay for a doctor to treat him -- and as an illegal, he's denied the ER (which in America at least tends to be the poor person's primary care). So the first time someone is going to look at him and realize he's sick is pretty much when he's dead."
t3_2mm2dl,cm5j6hr,"Good luck. he's been working under the table, so you don't know where he worked (wife says it's burger king, but no burger king admits to hiring him, 'cause you know ... illegal), you can't figure out which shifts even if you can find people who knew him at one location. So how do you warn the perhaps hundreds of people who he served over the course of the incubation period of the disease?"
t3_2lxha7,clz6dii,"And neither of those things are true. ""Ambiguous genitalia"" (I put in quotes because genitals are not ambiguous , you can definitely tell they're genitals even if they don't fit what your view of genitalia should look like) is not something that needs to be ""fixed."" Genitalia is on a spectrum, and no matter what it looks like, surgically altering it is not something for a doctor to decide unless there is a serious medical reason for that to happen."
t3_2lxha7,clz6dii,"But that doesn't mean the child won't be. We don't know how the surgery went, and even if it went well the child would still have to be taking medicine and doing upkeep to keep their vagina in working condition, that's assuming that they want to be having penetrative sex.

t3_2lo786,clwrur8,"A recognized, iconic play like Death of a Salesman takes out the question of whether it's a good role. You can't fake it on stage, even if you can on screen. Personally, I've seen famous actors like Phillip Seymour Hoffman on stage in NYC."
t3_2lo786,clwrur8,"But, that's not to say there aren't thousands of great actors in the US. I've seen plenty of non-famous actors like Tracy Letts who I would put among the best actors in America, even if they aren't cast as movie leads. "

t3_2kose9,clnb50a,"Instead, we have equitable dissolution, the parameters of which are outlined primarily by state marriage (not contract) laws. It was created to ensure both parties leave in the best way possible (even if it is imperfect) rather than ""making them pay."" Sure, we could keep these rules, but then we'd be circling right back to a special body of law that caters to the unique circumstances arising out of marriage that we just don't care about in a standard contracts."
t3_2kmgdw,clnnn7w,"If the wealthy don't want to pay for something, it doesn't get done. That means that it doesn't matter how the poor vote, the things they want aren't going to be implemented even if they're legislated. You seem to be primarily focusing on your desire not to pay for wars of empire."

t3_2joctk,cldknl1,"There is also a school of thoughts that when you are experiencing mental health problems like depression your brain chemistry is already out of whack, so using drugs to correct that is just like medicating any other illness.

t3_2jk4dx,clcyeh9,"That's a common psychological automatism to reduce URL and may even prevent traumates that could result from that cognitive dissonance.

Then they just do their thing, check papers, ask to empty my pockets, check my purse, see I'm not a threat and not the person they're looking for, they thank me and say ""sorry for the trouble"" and I can go back to my life."

t3_2i9k8i,cl0cf7y,"Equality is equivalent to justice - you want the laws and law enforcement set up so that no one has the ability to get away with commiting crimes against anyone else. Note that even if you, as a victim of a crime, feel no desire for revenge and don't want a man who robbed or assaulted you to suffer in any way, the fact that you personally forgive him doesn't give you a right to stop the government from prosecuting and punishing him, because the goal of the justice system is to protect other people , not to give you revenge.

t3_2i0v1l,ckxu3jp,"The main point is that you have arbitrarily chosen one limited route, and done the cost/benefit analysis on that choice alone, without taking the time to consider a wider array of options. Circling back to your time = money scenario, this expanded worldview allows you to retain your instilled sense of the value of time, but can show you that you are ""Wasting your time"" by only considering one life path, even if there are others that could lead to a higher earning potential and better enjoyment of life. Additionally, ask anyone in the business world about how EVERYTHING works, and they will all tell you that personal connections are hugely important."
t3_2hxjbt,ckx3oiu,I think the myriad miscommunication surrounding this word is apparent here and in regular discourse. Using a word that has such a vague colloquial meaning (even if the dictionary has a definition) is bad form in communication if you think it is likely possible that your conversation partner may misunderstand you.

I'm not sure what laws, if any, govern resource allocation with respect to high school teams, but even if we're not talking about money, it tends to be boys' sports teams that school spirit rallies behind and parental boosters choose to devote time to. It's their success that we tend to use as a gauge for whether a school is competitive in a sport or not; they're reputable."

t3_29koa9,cilvgjv,"Football players take hits sure, but when you're braced for it it's just not quite the same. Soccer players flop all the time too, but a lot of their time on the ground is legitimate, since they play with their feet it's easy for an opponent to get tangled up and bring a person to the ground even if there isn't a lot of force behind it. The thing about this example is it was a weak penalty call, but when the player was brought down in the box he lost a legitimate chance to cut in or pass the ball to a team mate and create a scoring chance."

t3_1yc8z3,cfj8dok,"Whether you take the hard line or the soft line regarding the paternalism/personal liberties debate, there are no legal precedents in the US for protecting people from decisions that are merely potentially regretful. Furthermore, even if you wanted to argue that your decision caused such regret that you suffered psychological harm that (you wish to argue) the government should have prevented it [with legislation], you would logically be inviting interference into any decision at all made under the influence, as regret is a subjective experience that can be caused by a range of activities - a drunk dial, binging on pizza, making out with a stripper, etc. I'm not speaking from experience, these are totally just examples."

The intent here was innocent, even if we might not agree with the actions in today's society. People at that time (especially religious types) believed masturbation to be evil; Kellogg no doubt believed that reducing a boy's desire to masturbate would be beneficial - reducing temptation to commit a sin."

In contrast, we're in a changing landscape with growing cohabitation, where you sort of have this tension between courts wanting to impose marriage-like rights and responsibilities on couples but the tedious and costly process of having to execute a plethora of legal documents to come close to the scheme that marriage presumptively creates and can later be tailored to your situation."
t3_1t46ur,ce487fh,"Sorry, but this just seems like an underhanded tactic to force fewer people to get abortions regardless of the reasons for the abortions. I see it more like this device would serve only as a deterrent to abortions by forcing people to actually end the life themselves (which many would not be able to emotionally do) or keep the child, even if they really don't want to simply because they cannot bring themselves to end a life with their own hands.

And even then, for any one individual, no guarantee exists that he/she would be successful, even if the odds were in his/her favor.

t3_1kcow1,cbnu6ah,"You're saying that people ""minimize slavery""... but what do you even think they mean by ""state's rights""? It's all one issue and the name for that issue is ""state's rights,"" even if that's a bit revisionist all in itself. The issue was never whether the South would give up slaves, but rather if its aristocracy would comply with something that would seriously reduce its wealth."
t3_1kcow1,cbnu6ah,"The South was still looking at tariffs and challenges to their fiefdoms, and Lincoln had no vested interest in abolishing slavery - abolition in the US was a tiny movement and the North was nearly as racist as the South. The issue, in truth, was power and the plantation owners were about to hemorrhage power and wealth even if they did keep their slaves, which was temporary at best given the currents in Europe. When they seceded they kept their slaves, but they actually expanded their power because now they were a separate country."
t3_1kbeez,cbn9wrg,"Pornos, if anything, take the satisfaction of women a little TOO for granted, and this can seriously impact the way men view their partner's reactions. The man in some ways exists to please the woman, even if the woman is objectified in the sense that it's the woman's pleasure that is important to pleasing the man. This is the big reason most pornos focus on the woman's moaning and whatnot rather than the feelings of the man as he uses her."

Unfortunately, if the universe does really work under rules of probability even if this is true, we'll never be able to predict the future with perfect certainty. So in conclusion, I would say that since the universe doesn't work on a strict A to B progression, and everything is built and seems exactly as though humans have free will, there are only two logical conclusions to come to: Either we have free will, or we have a perfectly functioning impression of free will that completes the same result."

It might seem too mundane to be an answer to your question, but really, sports are just one of many ways to bring people together, and I think that's great."

It's also possible that most of the money printed then has stayed with the banks that received it rather than fully entered the market, in which case it simply created more of a problem further down the road (not to mention: allowed banks whose unsound practices should mean that they went under to stay solvent and continue those practices."

t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"It's unfair to evaluate a meme's success by its ability to improve the propagation of the host's genes, for the same reason that it's unfair to evaluate a virus' success by that ability. Another relevant observation is that not every gene contributes to the host's survival - eg the large moose antlers that are subject to sexual selection but aren't beneficial to the individual, or the examples of genes that provide differential success by gender, so females carry the gene even if it hurts their own survivability, because it provides a significant benefit to their sons. So the relationship between genes and propagation isn't simple!"
t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"When cultures cross-fertilize, their memes do, too. At the genetic level, individuals can produce fertile offspring even if their genes aren't identical - a blue-eyed man can have children with a brown-eyed woman, right? I think you're begging the question a bit here."

t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"Thought of so generally, the different disciplinary arena don't seem so closed off from one another. So, even if one doesn't buy into Christianity (as I don't), one might think that that Aristotle dude had some pretty sharp ideas (as I do) and realize that most of the effect that Aristotle has had on the world has been via Aquinas, and that, therefore, if I want to talk about the Aristotelian distinction between form and content in literature, that many (especially older) literary works, and some of my more religious students, will frame that distinction as paralleling the relation between the material substance of the Son and the ideal substance of the Father. The problem with framing such meaning making as a fundamentally religious question is that religion in general, and Christianity in particular usually presents itself not as an answer, not as one partial explanation , but as a totalizing and exclusive explanation (what Northorp Frye, himself a devout Christian, referred to as an apocalyptic symbolic regime)."

t3_1cocdc,c9igpaa,"Here are a few reasons why the market for healthcare is not the same as a regular market, and hence why I fear the usual conclusions of economics do not apply: It follows a principle-agent model, so I have to trust that the doctor is providing only the care I need and not the care that is most lucrative for him (considerable evidence exists to show this is a problem even in the UK, and it is as beyond doubt as a question in the social sciences can be that it happens in the US)

 There is impossible asymmetry in the market; insurance providers cannot observe how healthy you are when you apply for insurance and patients are canny enough to lie if asked, so the result is that the healthy are under-insured, the ill (and elderly) are over-insured and the poor are shafted. Demand is irregular, and I can't predict my need for healthcare in advance, meaning I can't take steps to reduce my other consumption before I consume healthcare

 Production is irregular; I pay for healthcare but I want health, and I can't guarentee that my purchase of healthcare will result in health Avoidance of using the service is impossible (or at least very unlikely), meaning I cannot purchase a substitute to healthcare

 Moreover, when I use the service I am (usually) not a rational consumer - a man having a heart attack can't pick a hospital four hours away because it has better reviews on Yelp, and even if he tells paramedics he wants to go there they would be negligent if they didn't just completely ignore him. The profession is restricted by licensing, artificially creating an - important - barrier to entry

t3_341rgm,cqr37bi,"In fact, it may be logically impossible to never screw someone over. This, it may not ever be possible to have an innate guidance that always does right by everyone, even if we were all on board for trying. So government is a pragmatic."
t3_340hb6,cqq5pcx,"It raises another red flag to be so categorical about it (you're not just saying you have a mild preference, like you usually prefer blondes to brunettes, it's literally a deal-breaker for the person to be black?) And finally, even if it seems to you to just be a matter of taste in looks, it's quite possible you're harboring some subconscious prejudice that is influencing your preferences. Like maybe you associate black women with being loud and aggressive, and you don't like loud and aggressive women, so when looking at a black woman you might subsconciously lower her rating a bit based on this stereotype."
t3_33odih,cqmx2gy,"We might as well throw up our hands and never attempt to fix anything if we can't make it 100% perfect on the first try. The cameras will fix SOMETHING even if it is not perfect, and if they can save one innocent life then it is worth the investment. "
t3_33fvr1,cql32pv,"We have pretty much agreed as a society that the correct standard to use in criminal cases is ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". We do this because without it, no one could ever be convicted of anything, because there is always doubt, even if it might be unreasonable. It's a tradeoff between the safety of many innocent people vs. the safety of a very small number of innocent people."
t3_32w62j,cqf8h6r,"The direction of that grief or rage may often be molded by a director, but is he/she not still expressing that emotion? Likewise, musicians can still feel and be expressive about the music they are creating even if the direction of those emotions is determined by a conductor. What's more, creativity in playing can come from a number of factors, especially technically."
t3_32jy1s,cqc12jh,"I suggest looking up the UCCJEA and how it would apply. My understanding is that the IL court would actually maintain jurisdiction, even if she moved. The law was passed for the exact purpose of keeping parents from fleeing the jurisdiction of a court that rendered an unfavorable decision and seeking a conflicting custody decision elsewhere."
t3_32cire,cq9xxgy,"Even if they avoid voting altogether, it still helps the other candidate by denying votes to their opponent. It seems like even if a person is sexist, not many are so extreme that they would vote against their own best interests because of it. "
t3_320ncw,cq70944,"Debates, verbal or otherwise, don't have to get in the way of this. Some people are more fun when you can argue with them; but even if your mom isn't one of them, that doesn't mean that working silently to push back against her prejudices will make your relationship weaker, or that buckling under and letting her pressure you into acting as though you think her worldview is acceptable will make her company more enjoyable.

t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"In order to consume, you have to produce (which is why GDP is important). Things like unemployment, debt, lack of consumer confidence, extreme wealth inequality, delayed entry of young people into the workforce all have a depreciatory effect on production, which, even if it doesn't affect the economy that much today, will catch up with us later. That's why the EU is in deep crisis - because the things I have named are screwed up for structural reasons, meaning they won't get fixed when the global economy gets fixed - they will only get fixed when the EU gets its shit together and manages itself properly."
t3_316gw1,cpyrtai,"There's certainly a lot of bad writing out there. I just hope that I've been able to do a decent job of explaining the value of literature in the abstract, even if the execution can be messed up.

t3_30oi71,cpudthh,"Once welfare recipients start working, if they report it, they lose benefits quickly and remain poor, and if they do not report it they are committing fraud and risk jail. A recipient who saves or invests a windfall can be kicked off of benefits for having assets even if they have no ongoing income, forcing them to spend down until they again have nothing left and forcing them to spend several months with no assets or income while they reapply for benefits. Advocates for the poor receive training in how to advise their clients to spend down windfalls without running afowl of many complicated rules essentially advising their poor clients in how to remain poor."
t3_302atl,cponldu,"But the thing is that he trusts that they both have his best intentions at heart, not that he literally believes everything they say. It's very likely that even if Hank told Dale, Dale would refuse to believe Hank, think that Hank is telling a joke or not being serious, or believe in any other cognitive dissonant thoughts because as far as Dale is concerned, Nancy will never harm him. I mean, Dale already knows that he is not Joseph's biological dad and that John Redcorn was alone with Nancy on the day that she got pregnant."
t3_301n6h,cpolqex,"Minority characters are 1) stereotyped by default, 2) harder for the majority White audience to relate to. There's less parts available for non-white actors, in general, and there's less stories being told about explicitly non-white characters because that's what sells.^1 In Unbreakable , there's an explicitly Native part, an explicitly Native part in a relatively mainstream television show (even if it's a Netflix exclusive), and it's... given to a white actress instead. That's why people are upset about it, it's like dangling a perfect steak in front of someone who hasn't eaten in a day and then snatching it away."
t3_301n6h,cpolqex,"The phrasing makes it seem dubious to me on whether or not that person actually has a tribal membership. But anyway, even if they are part of a tribe, there's at least one Native who's annoyed by the casting choice and URL . It's not like one Native person (who wants to keep their job) on staff suddenly makes everything okay by all Indians everywhere."

t3_30059g,cpo18q6,"Meanwhile, Fluffy can easily stay at home alone for 3 hours with zero harm to them and zero chance of having them taken away for neglect. This is a huge distinction for parents, even if it's something that may not occur to you if you don't have kids of your own. [Edit] I just want to add - there are some restaurants (and other venues) where you really shouldn't bring your kids, either."
t3_2zxz9r,cpnemdd,"Additionally, although more of a logistics issue, it's questionable if a formal education program could even be designed to equally help all groups' interests. Secondly, even if voters are ignorant, things might just be alright. On a whole, political parties do a relatively good job at organizing the public into making good decisions."
t3_2zxz9r,cpnemdd,"Ultimately, the judicial system can do a decent job at solidifying non-rational policy. Another point to consider is that even if the average voter is apathetic and uneducated, this might be necessary for the smooth functioning of the system. If all citizens were highly knowledgeable and highly passionate regarding political issues, then elections would have far higher stakes than they currently do."
t3_2zwjql,cpmyb0w,"Just because it's physically possible for them to do something doesn't mean it's actually possible. This is a big point when it comes to chronic conditions, whether they're physical or mental: that entirely mental conditions can hold you back from doing something even if you're physically able to do it. When it comes to physical illness, the most common issue is with chronic pain."
t3_2zow2m,cpl22pp,"It takes a lot of work, a lot of introspection and a good network of empathetic friends who will listen to you when times are tough and laugh with you when times are good. A relationship would be the cherry on top, sure, but a sundae is more than just the cherry, much more, even if it is improved by its addition. None of this is to say you should not pursue relationships."
t3_2zlzlv,cpk93ep,"In theory, most restaurants wipe down the table between guests. Whether it's the breadcrumbs I've left, or stuff that fell of my plate, there is usually some debris (and even if there isn't, I'm hoping you're still going to wipe down the table). For most items, really, how much harder is it pick up some extra salt?"
t3_2zlzlv,cpk93ep,"Assuming your restaurant had a kid's menu, the expectation was that they'd be serving kids, and a reasonable amount of sticky is just part of the package that your management decided was worth dealing with to get parents through the door. To put it another way, I don't bring wet wipes with me when I eat in a restaurant, even if there's a chance that I'll drop a pat of butter, or that a ketchup-covered fry might fall off my plate. I consider that part of the expected service."
t3_2ziiud,cpjgxr8,"Death is the ultimate unknown. Even if you say scientifically, we know what happens in death...even if you say we know for certain that death is simply the end of existence and that's it...you're still left with the unknown. All we know is existence; every individual has existed as far back as they can remember."
t3_2yx7xp,cpdtd1o,I think we're just opening the dialogue to people who might otherwise avoid the entire conversation.

I feel that, even if the pain was willing to try out of not wanting to let the country fall into chaos, they'd detail during their presidency. Not feeling like they are good for it means that every small failing or wrong decision will play on them heavily, compounding their stress further."
t3_2xavrb,coynv9t,"Can you name any specific examples of a site that got a review copy giving a game an above average rating while the majority of non review copy sites didn't? And even if you can, can you prove beyond reasonable doubt that that is not the reviewers opinion, but because the site makes them? We see the literal opposite of your proposal with Ryan Mccafery's Alien: Isolation Review, proving that a big site can get copies before others and give the game a negative review."

If we add the ""threshold condition"", then even if people are very selfless , they will still continue to choose B if everyone else has chosen B, because switching to A would only help if they were convinced that everyone else would switch to A, too, to get under the threshold. So this is a collective action problem because the benefit that everyone gets from following a collective decision is larger than the benefit they get from the sum of decisions that make sense for the individuals (including, as we saw in the threshold case, altruistic individuals)."

Next, I would extend this to cases where the people choosing between A and B are different from the people who are hurt by B."

t3_2ucr50,co77nij,"Having been an avid hiker for a long time when I was younger, it's hard to overstate the value of a waterproof watch with a built in compass when there's no cell phones, no electricity and normal landmarks aren't handy. Two points: Watches can be a fashion accessory for men (and women) just like any other piece of jewelry; in that regard a watch is actually more functional than a simple bracelet or ring because it can do something, even if another tool can also do it. If you can't afford jewelry, that's fine; but saying jewelry is dumb or you don't see the point of it because you can't afford it fails to acknowledge that it's simply a matter of taste, which flows to fashion, which flows to art."

t3_2teulf,cnyf7vq,"There's the fact that many colleges are also research institutions. If these professors are doing good research, the college will want to keep them around for that even if they're bad teachers.
