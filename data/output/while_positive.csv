t3_2rnfn0,cnhn263,"But it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's ""obvious to you"" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. If you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them."
t3_2rnfn0,cnhssu7,"But it's extremely rare, and when you do, you really have to do a thorough job of it, or it ends up being counterproductive. Therefore, in general, I have to disagree with OP that ""it's a worthwhile endeavor"", particularly when the explanation is given to the victim rather than society at large, because the victim most likely already has an inflated view of the risks of the situation. In the vast majority of cases, someone ""explaining causation"" has far too little information to actually explain causation, such an explanation is almost entirely trivial, and the causation in any particular instance has very little to do with either the victim's situation or the overall societal problem."
t3_2rk7my,cngoaq7,Mortality for drivers in the US is roughly 50 per millions. Death while working in construction in 2006 was 108 per millions. Driving is not the most dangerous thing these workers do in their everyday life.
t3_2rgs7o,cngkdic,"As for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning. May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist. Your bleak view reminds me of the Queen line from Bohemian Rhapsody, ""I don't wanna die."
t3_2rekjo,cnf6qyu,"Yeah, I think there's just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time, and issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight. So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues. So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to ignore that issue."
t3_2r6a86,cncxf4c,"Some people prefer some things and some people prefer other things. If I play a game, I want to maximize the amount of fun I have while doing it. Some people think items add to the fun, like you, and others think that they remove the fun."
t3_2qu6fg,cn9rm4s,"Depending on the severity of enforcement and criminal penalties, the cost of illegal supply can extend to social costs associated with a black market.

t3_2qrlmm,cn8va27,"I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially. I'll make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that, while it should be simplified, a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function. First, take criminal law."

t3_2q5zwb,cn37lx6,"Asami was a pretty important character even back in book 1! And while she was pushed to the sideline in book 2 she came back with a bang and is just as part of the krew as Bolin. But really, why is pairing up a main character with a minor one (not that Asami was, mind) bad fiction?"
t3_2q5zwb,cn3a2fw,"But in book 3 she got Korra out of the oasis place on Naga, she got them out of the Earth Queen's captivity, she then rescued Korra and the airship crew from the desert. She was a constant companion to Korra the entire time and while she didn't have a whole lot to do at the climax (four incredibly powerful benders going up against a nonbender) she was still there for Korra. Then in book 4 she had entire storylines that were just her own."

t3_2pw9tv,cn0lprd,"Objections to 2 : First, the making of  The Interview* had a variety of purposes other than making fun of Kim Jong Un for the sake of being mean. It would have (a) provided audiences with entertainment and (b) made money for Sony, all the while (c) drawing attention to how evil Kim John Un is and (d) undermining his credibility. These are clearly distinct motives from making fun of Kim Jong Un for the sole purpose of being mean."
t3_2pi2xh,cmww0ol,"If you're going to have frats anyway, having them associated with the university probably makes things better on net. Yes, I recognize the link above is a press release and biased; it was just the first example of such a program I found while googling. "
t3_2p8d3m,cmub3xl,"Lets say that the rich and lucky are 1% of the population, that means that 99% of the population do not have that option. If hard work is the best chance of success available, then it may be the only worth while option that you have. Your choice is between hard work and failure unless you are already rich or lucky."
t3_2p3d0h,cmszlym,Violated because his body was used in a sexual manner without his knowledge or consent. Someone was touching him and doing things to him while he was unconscious. Can you imagine!
t3_2p3d0h,cmszlym,"People often feel violated if a burglar breaks into their house and doesn't even take anything just because the knowledge of someone in their house when they weren't aware creeps them out... now imagine if a person ""breaks into"" your body. Sure, they ""didn't do anything"" as in he wasn't raped, but his body was touched and handled while he was unconscious, which is horrible. And touched in a way that he wouldn't consent to if he was conscious, so doubly horrible."
t3_2p3d0h,cmszlym,"As victims/survivors of sexual assault often do, he's blaming himself. He's feeling like HE'S a ""slut"" because someone else violated him while he was asleep. He's internalizing this incident as his own fault and feeling guilty for it."
t3_2ottrr,cmqmfx7,"Global warming may cost a few trillion dollars over a few centuries, and it might shift shorelines, but I'm doubtful that it's a really big existential risk. A global warming-triggered mass extinction event would take place over a pretty long time scale (thousands of years or more; correct me if you have real estimates for this) while technology has been accelerating exponentially (yes, I know it can't do this forever, but even in 50 years we should be much closer to solving this problem). How about the idea that the first eukaryote was a pretty unique event?"
t3_2ook4i,cmp3sav,"Everybody learns differently. Some people get a lot out of lectures (from either the lecture itself or note-taking), while others get nothing from lectures. Some people can effectively self-educate by working through a textbook, while others appreciate the additional guidance that a formal course provides."

Some people can effectively self-educate by working through a textbook, while others appreciate the additional guidance that a formal course provides. Furthermore, different subjects differ in the ease to which one can self educate oneself in them."
t3_2oo3qw,cmp0nen,"Parties are also useful because they provide cognitive shortcuts for representatives as well. By that, I mean that each party can have a common platform for each policy area, while individual members can specialize in particular policy areas and have strong beliefs and values on the issues they or their constituents care about, while being ""rank and file"" supporters for their party's general policy agenda. Now as far as the specific policy issue of net neutrality, I would like to point out that there are legitimate criticisms of the current proposal that are compelling in light of the post-Snowden era."
t3_2oo3qw,cmp0nen,"Of course, that doesn't change the fact that the prominent Republican criticisms of it rely on ad hominem arguments to oppose legitimately problematic policies (that they would, in all actuality, probably be okay with if their guy was in the White House). Ever since 2010 we've seen this kind of political posturing against the Obama administration, and while that campaign has been intellectually dishonest and very damaging in some ways, it's important to acknowledge and respect this persistent proportion of Americans who are genuinely not okay with the direction that the country is going. While the individual arguments they may articulate on any given issue can come across as fallacious, there's an underlying cognitive shortcut in their opposition that stems from the fact that they disagree with the principles that President Obama and the Democratic Party use to justify their policies."
t3_2oo3qw,cmp0nen,"The solution they proposed was that every major policy be a compromise, where neither side really gets what they want. But when we're not left with the situation where someone can be considered three-fifths of a person, our simple-majority election system sometimes results in one side getting everything they want while the other 49% don't get anything, and that can breed a lot of hatred and frustration in people.

t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"There are other examples in media that are doing the same thing better, like 500 Days of Summer or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but as far as books reaching a wide preteen and teen audience, I feel like John Green does a solid job at creating more multi-dimensional characters, even if they can still come off as generic and trope-y in their own ways. As an 18-year old guy, for a long while I was definitely on the same page as you about John Green. I was really fed up with all the tumblr hype and with all the people at school who were so proud to be nerd-fighters."
t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"I think it's really important to see books that show the female romantic lead to the introverted male protagonist as a flawed human and not just a collection of traits that change the life of the protagonist. It has been a trend in the industry for a really long time to just have very flat female characters, and while maybe not the most mature or intelligent handling of the issue, I respect it for being an attempt that's reaching a wide audience. There are other examples in media that are doing the same thing better, like 500 Days of Summer or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but as far as books reaching a wide preteen and teen audience, I feel like John Green does a solid job at creating more multi-dimensional characters, even if they can still come off as generic and trope-y in their own ways."
t3_2oj6fq,cmnogog,"The force, specifically the dark side, is like a drug. Only while most real world drugs merely make you stupid, the dark side makes you evil. Evil people don't simply use the dark side, the very use of the dark side makes them more evil, creating this positive feedback loop of hate and anger and lust for power."
t3_2o6paa,cmkar1d,"There's nothing wrong with that. However, one cannot accept that evolution is true while also holding the belief that life on earth has always existed in its current form. These ideas are at odds with each other."
t3_2nu3l8,cmh3ww9,"Why deny the particularity and uniqueness of something just because they can be subsumed in larger categories? Why not find aspects inside those very groups that promote and allow for the interaction with the groups outside of them; in ways that allow for both of those groups to come to a deeper understanding of themselves, while exploring each other in more organic--site specific--ways? If this kind of exploration leads to some kind of new hybridity between these groups (resulting in a new group) or ways in which they can get along with each other at arms length (maintaining the same groups), then so be it."
t3_2nu3l8,cmh66bb,"It's a double-sided coin. We identify with people we feel emotionally connected with, but there is something inside the groups we do not identify with that allows for us to both completely cast aside, dominate or demonize them while also recognizing something entirely other than us. It is this otherness that has the power to allow us to also recognize our own finiteness nature and our responsibility to all the immensely different and varied things that lie outside our particular in groups."
t3_2npkc0,cmfr5ol,"The vast majority of historical documents up until this point deal in the system I provided. To suddenly drop the ""18th century"" in favor of the ""1700s"" would create confusion between decades and centuries, while making it even more difficult for people who you claim already can't understand the system, considering they would not be exposed to the format as frequently. "
t3_2np4sw,cmfnqft,"Many charities are required to spend a certain amount of funds they receive, toward the goal. So a huge influx of cash, while definitely helpful, may actually be MUCH less helpful than targeted donations over the course of many years. I find this link to be an unfair support of your argument."
t3_2np4sw,cmfoh41,"I know full well I can come off as harsh and adversarial, even if I try not to. I thought we were both firm, while being respectful (wish I had been a bit more so myself). It's too rare on Reddit you can leave someone a robust reply, and receive a robust response, all void of personal insults and jabs, so thank you."
t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"Point 2 was that its plausible that a pacifist could believe that in the long term , pacifism is always right, as it establishes a standard and precedent of nonviolence. Accepting some violence to prevent future violence, while nice in the short run, may ultimately be settling for a long term level of violence that the pacifist thinks that we can beat. Point 3 was about judging a framework by its results and not its theoretical properties."
t3_2neyur,cmd1tqr,"He was a previously a member of a police department URL . So while I would agree that technically, we can never know exactly why the events transpired the way it did, I would strongly argue against the idea that pointing out the racial dynamics of Ferguson and the Michael Brown situation specifically is a ""cop-out"". There are clear racial tensions in the area, and a history of racialized police brutality."
t3_2nejw6,cmcw398,"Mi'kmaq and Mowhawk) would fight one another regularly. Fast-forward to today, and while they still have their distinct cultures, they are united under the label of ""indigenous"" or ""native american"". Point being, race, ethnicity, and culture are very fluid categories, and you just have to have a cursory understanding of history to understand that through collaboration, solidarity, and mutual struggle, these categories can become increasingly blurred and irrelevant."
t3_2n8psp,cmbnpay,"Instead, it's just ""do I like being with this person, do I care about her, and does she feel the same about me?"" Pretty soon, you start to realize that sex and romance aren't off in some special categories, unlike all other interpersonal relationships, such that they and they alone must be unique in your life while all others can be shared. There's no point to it."
t3_2n8psp,cmbnpay,"Some are more serious than others, but each relationship can develop as it will. One of my girlfriends is with another man, who's married to yet another woman, and while I'm sure that sounds strange as hell to most, I found I don't worry about that at all. He seems pretty cool, actually."
t3_2n8psp,cmbnpay,"Getting a new lover doesn't replace the old at all, it's just another person, just as getting a new friend doesn't replace a lost best friend. But now that I've been doing this a while, I've found I don't lose lovers nearly so badly anymore. I was just last night hanging out with my ex of 8 years."
t3_2n8psp,cmc2p7e,"The only thing I can offer is my own experience. Before I encountered polyamory, I had a lot of relationships end in resentment because I fell in love with someone else while in a serious relationship. Mind you, I felt no less love for the person I was in a committed relationship with and I never would have acted upon those feelings."
t3_2n6s5w,cmav500,"Among the major philosophies of our time (or times just before ours -- I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm 25 and don't feel comfortable claiming stuff from the 60's-80's as 'mine') are: Feminism, which is an inherently postmodern field of critical theory
 Subatomic physics, which is arguably an example of science moving beyond strict empiricism and into new epistemological territory (I say arguable because I wouldn't agree with it but the fact that the argument even makes sense to have is relevant and important) * Democratic socialism, which is an area of political thought that meaningfully approaches the criticisms of strict capitalism that Marx raised, without falling into the serious shortcomings that come with a modernist interpretation of socialism Furthermore, achievements like the internet -- or, to get more specific, Wikipedia -- represent accomplishments in the human organization of knowledge that were literally unthinkable during the enlightenment. (And, in fact, were pretty much unthinkable right up until a while after Wikipedia was already working.) This is a drastically incomplete description of the important things going on in the intellectual world today, but even that speaks to my point -- we have achieved heights of intellectual complexity that defy summary."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"I still can't bring myself to say that word without remembering those times. It went on for a while, I remember the last time though. Threatening to scream when his mum was downstairs, we were in his room and he'd locked the door."
t3_2mesct,cm3nquu,"You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Except the fans do expect the stop and it's the restrained feeling of it that may be appealing as you still hold some of that built-up tension while the music continues. - As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled."
t3_2mesct,cm3nquu,"Do you mean that all of the tension was not properly removed? The trap fans still feel fulfilled at the end, but they achieve this by seeking a different experience from you: you expect a build and release, while they expect to retain the build beyond the peak, maybe because they enjoy the tense feeling as you enjoy the feeling of being thrilled. Our experience of tension and thrills is completely subjective in itself, so the perceived quality of different tracks in EDM - which is mainly based around pursuing a certain experience that audience finds enjoyable (this extends to a large proportion of music) - would be subjective."
t3_2mesct,cm8fw8c,"For others, such as yourself, this is uncomfortable. This is where the subjective nature of art and music applies as the audience of tap music enjoys the experience while others don't and these differences are the reason for the diversity of genres. - Trap seems to forego rhythmic complexity of its influences (at least in the heavily electronic-influenced Trap I have identified in the examples in the edits above)."
t3_2lzhcj,clzk61h,"Why can't it just be someone saying ""I'm proud to be a veteran, and stand with other veterans today""? Often many people don't know someone served, especially if they have been out of the service for a while. It puts a human face on a vague ""veteran"" category for people who may not know that they know a veteran."
t3_2lwv67,clywrsu,"It's virtually impossible for the average individual to start a business. The cozy attitude between government and business leads to regulatory capture that freezes out competition from either Japanese Entrepreneurs or foreign firms while weakening the effectiveness of regulation to protect the people (as seen by the Fukushima disaster). It's operating largely on inertia at this stage, and it is holding together as well as can be expected with some pretty significant advantages of almost complete cultural uniformity and uniquely favorable trade and geopolitical conditions."
t3_2lqcby,clx66ss,"So what does that mean for the street harassment law? First, while the goal is worthwhile, it probably isn't a compelling government interest. Street harassment doesn't threaten public safety, and rarely constituted a true threat to someone's safety."

Suddenly, we have turned someone uninformed into someone informed Cons: * Some people who are uninformed choose to vote while still uninformed, simply to gain the benefits from their teacher or employer. This might be bad, but has almost zero negative impact on the results of voting when taking into account the millions of other informed votes."
t3_2l9paa,clspte1,"Quite a bit of the lead up to elections(debates, meetings, talks, speeches) deal with policy. Remember that while some politicians simply don't follow through on their promises, others cant. If I promise something, but when I am elected the budget won't allow it or it won't pass- I simply can do nothing about it."
t3_2kypt8,clpwjwi,"For a little country like Hungary to go against that, it could wreck our connection to worldwide culture. Water and electricity are actual physical materials that are being diverted in your way when you use them, while data is not. It's not like your ISP has gigabytes of data stored in a warehouse, and when you download a youtube video, there would remain a bit less afterwards."
t3_2kuu7n,clp4b7x,"Your choice to buy or not corrects their pricing. Yet you can have large companies with healthy competition that are good for consumers, but most of the profit is taken by the very top while wages for the average worker stagnate. That issue is best corrected by taxing the wealthy individuals at progressive rates, rather than the company itself."
t3_2kqfel,clnqzy5,"1. Road size: Living in a fairly dense urban area, the physical size of the road is often not conducive to a cyclist (or a motorist for that matter) being able to always be more than a door length away from all parked cars while still being a safe distance from oncoming traffic. On most of the roads on my daily commute, riding in the exact center of my direction lane still puts me in danger of coming in contact with an open door."
t3_2kqfel,clns4yt,"If it weren't dark outside right now, I would snap a picture of the road that I live on, possibly with a cyclist riding by, to show you what I'm talking about. It is just wide enough that, when cars are parked on both sides of the road, there is just enough space for normal sized cars to pass each other in opposite directions while traveling no faster than 25 mph. When in my car, there have been times driving in my neighborhood where I've had to pull to the side and stop to let a delivery van travel past."
t3_2kqfel,clns4yt,"When I am traveling in a straight line in my legally designated lane and within the confines of the speed limit, whether on a bicycle or in a motor vehicle, I am operating in a safe manner. Opening your door while parked on the street without checking your mirror for traffic is equivalent to simply shoving your vehicle into the next lane over on the freeway without checking behind you. In both cases, it's your responsibility as the person deviating from the status quo to ensure that the maneuver is safe for you and your fellow road occupants."
t3_2ko5tx,cln523m,"So, what accompanies the sugars/ calories in an apple? A shit ton of vitamins, fiber, and various other nutrients that make the sugar content worth your while. Also, they are relatively low in calories because of their near 0 fat/ protein content."
t3_2kmgdw,clnnn7w,"You seem to be primarily focusing on your desire not to pay for wars of empire. But while you might not be paying for them, these wars would probably become more common under this system.

t3_2kkqbm,clmbeod,"There's a pretty persuasive paper about children being URL - that link is to the official ""TL;DR,"" as it were. That's like a negative externality in reverse - parents shoulder a disproportionate cost of raising kids (the tax credits are a joke compared to the actual costs involved - and that's just the monetary costs; we're not even talking about time and other less tangible resources), while society reaps the benefit of a replacement generation. Now - in a society with low infant/maternal mortality rates, it's good that so many people are opting to have no kids (or, like our family, opting to have just the one)."

t3_2k6r90,clij0jm,"The US actually has an identical tertiary enrollment rate to all the Nordic countries. A fairly persistent problem in the US (its existed since the 80's) and to a lesser extent elsewhere is that even with a rise in education skills acquisition has been relatively flat, while people are entering and graduating from tertiary education at increased rates their marketable skills are not increasing. The problem here is caused by insufficient information being available to those embarking on tertiary education, they don't understand what the future value of their skills will be so make poor choices regarding which skills to acquire."
t3_2k6r90,clij0jm,"A better intermediate model which largely accomplishes what you are likely looking for would be the German system.

t3_2jr2px,clec1be,"I don't see why being male or female would make a difference here. Presumably, the argument is that men aren't the ones who'll be directly affected by the opinions and decisions while females would be, but this fails to take into account that the bias can run both ways: one could be looking out for one's self interest without regard to a greater good. Moreover, this reasoning, if applied across the board, would render most opinions invalid."

Because of the inefficiencies of the market, however, it can be worthwhile for the government to step in, and create a public system on some level. Because it is the government entering into an otherwise private market, that's essentially what socialism, by most definitions is."

t3_2j196u,cl7nh5y,"As I hope I've made clear with these few examples, the idea of ""rape culture"" is not about a culture that explicitly endorses rape. It's about a culture that  says* it abhors it, while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault. Note that this doesn't mean there are people out there that actually are trying to ensure that people are sexually assaulted; it just means that, out of ignorance or support of the status quo, we as a society end up reinforcing these norms and institutions, to our own detriment."

And, you know... you can actually see with your eye that people have different physical traits ."
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"So when you say: All races will never be 'indistinguishable' from each other. Furthermore, this argument, while riding the coattails of the current, feel-good, leftist understanding of humanity is actually rather disparaging to the differences between ethnic groups.

So while it makes no difference for the adults, the children (who likely have no choice in what is purchased) do benefit. It's 100% bullshit for people to think that bad spending wouldn't occur since $100 dedicated to groceries just means I have $100 I would have spent otherwise, but as far as what I've seen empirically, it does appear that SNAP benefits childhood nutrition."

When one team is in the offensive zone (trying to score,) they need to maintain control of the puck while they set up opportunities for themselves. The common ""base"" setup is one player at each corner of the blue line, one in each corner/slot, and one directly in front of the net."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrl5p9,"Every player must constantly think about where they should position themselves in order to make this work. The defensemen at the blueline also need to keep an eye on any opposing players trying to rush, while doing all this.

I think skill is the most difficult to quantify, but what I will say is that boxing, unlike football requires a wide variety of skills, footwork, form, endurance, strength, etc, while football players are more specialized. I think that this shows that even if American football has slightly more skill, the lack of strategic depth and lower athleticism make boxing a far superior sport based on the criteria you've given."

However, with full automation, there is no such thing as an unskilled labor force anymore; while you could simply educate everyone beyond the gap, this has several fundamental issues associated with it. First, at least in the US, we have a political class that has a severe hate on for public schooling; at least two of the likely candidates for the 2016 Presidential election (Rick Perry and Rand Paul) advocate eliminating the Federal Department of Education entirely, and they are taken seriously on this matter."

So, while many have argued for the position whereby marriage is not an institution recognized by the government, I will take a slightly different approach to arguing for that position. Let's start with the crux of the issue: currently where same sex marriage is not legally recognized, those couples that would otherwise be legally married are not entitled to the same legal benefits as heterosexual married couples."

By freeing society up, by allowing people to spend less on taxes (in America, people spend 30-40% on taxes - they revolted when they paid 1-2% during a little Tea Party), one allows people to keep what they earn and demand less while sustaining themselves.

At their core, English classes are meant to teach students the English language."
t3_23vvzm,ch1f49t,"The human brain has an innate capacity to comprehend and mimic language and, because of this, giving students a chance to consume literature allows their brains to unconsciously soak up all the things that would have been lost and forgotten if it had been taught as theory. I know that in my experience (both as a student and a teacher), nearly every obstacle a student might run into while learning the English language can be solved through more reading. Nearly all students who struggle in English are not readers in their free time (and are rarely readers even when their grade depends on it) and the students who do well in English classes are usually habitual readers."

Simply put, we humans have had immense impact on the artificial selection and evolution of companion animals and livestock, with the result being that traits such as empathy and intelligence were desired and selected for in companion animals, while those traits are often found in meat animals, as they were selected for docility and mass. I would argue that it is therefore less ethical to repurpose an intelligent, empathetic companion animal for meat, particularly since evolution of those characteristics were intentionally caused by mankind."

Without an entrenched institution to externalize the costs of violence, and with no universally agreed upon medium of exchange, getting people to willingly fork over the necessary resources to make violence worthwhile on a large scale would prove difficult (just to illustrate my point, if GWB had to pay for the Iraq War out of pocket, he couldn't have paid for a little more than a day). The ones who manage the system depend on a docile, obedient class of workers which they can siphon resources from in order to commit to large scale war and violence ; without a population willing to believe the fiction of the state ^1 and having one which is generally more exposed to libertarian (in the broadest sense, as contrasted with authoritarianism, just so my meaning isn't lost) ideas, it becomes significantly more difficult to get people to comply."

Being ""chaotic"" has a very precise mathematical sense, and while it is quite technical, I will focus on one very important aspect : For any initial state X at time t, there is another initial state Y arbitrarily close to the first one, the evolution of X will be arbitrarily far from the evolution of Y after some finite time T. This means that however close to X I restrict my search, I will still find such a Y that after some finite time we can distinguish both as being ""different"". This property is called ""Heavy dependance on initial conditions""."

With that groundwork laid, I'll advance my position that while for some value systems, a lack of empathy may make success for the individual more likely in that it frees him/her to act without concern for others and thus with more focus to his/her own ends, it cannot be held universally true for all value systems and might potentially be more detrimental. I think it's been dealt with to some degree in the thread, but just to state it for the record, I believe OP has conceded that for his claim to hold true, the lack of empathy must be accompanied by the ability to simulate empathy."

There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both URL and URL (two very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural."
t3_1kkzei,cbq19sn,What's the point from which you are getting the idea that a human life of power is one that is desirable to have? Some of the greatest warlords in history lead terrible lives while in a complete state of power.

I could conceivably be pleasured by someone to whom I am not attracted, though I personally feel the knowledge that they were not attractive would put me off sexually."
t3_1kj8ll,cbpjmas,"I might ""love"" my friends, in that there is a personal attraction between us (an attraction between personalities), but unless there is a corresponding sexual attraction, I just cannot feel romantic love. Therefore, while I may be personally attracted to people of any gender, and of any physical appearance, I can only fall in love with physically attractive members of my preferred sex with whom I have a personal connection. If you experience romantic love differently, in that you romantically love those that you find physically unattractive, then you simply have a different sexual identity than I do."

The electric motor also has the benefit of being able to convert both electrical energy to kinetic energy, and vice versa - that is, it can be used to recover energy while braking, whereas conventional car braking setups cannot. This is another point in which hybrids beat conventional cars for efficiency."
t3_1ke0w4,cbnzi22,"In terms of the number of (great) friends I can see and the frequency I see them with, owning a smartphone has probably increased that a full order of magnitude as compared to just a few years ago when I didn't have a smart phone. If someone cancels plans, I can create new plans immediately, meeting at a restaurant none of us has ever tried before (but we can verify it gets good reviews while en route), share pictures and music. Someone else mentioned finding directions and you said you could do the same with a simple GPS."

Watch media like Netflix/Hulu Plus, pump music at the gym, use the IR blaster on my phone to remotely control my camera, television, cable box, and projector, listen to police/firefighter/EMT scanners, watch my Blu-ray movies on the go, set up a dash cam/spy cam to record while I drive or record my property while I'm away, and so much more. Conclusion You bring up things like laptops, dumbphones, regular cameras, handheld GPS units, etc."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo3zx9,"Let's face facts, a smartphone isn't the best at any one particular task. But that it performs thousands of tasks, any of which you can sync with other tasks for greater efficiency and results, and it does all of that while fitting in your hand and weighing so very little, is why people get smartphones. On average, my phone plan costs me a little over $2 a day."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo3zx9,"In fact, my phone allows me to save easily more than $2 a day, thanks to time and money savings that I wouldn't have were it not for having a smartphone. The convenience added alone is worthwhile, and that includes the initital cost of the phone itself. The best part is that you don't even need the latest and greatest device or the most souped up carrier service."

If you and two buddies all agree that instead of competing with each other at the bar wooing ladies, that you would instead talk each other up, and while of course doing your best to help yourself, to help your friends too, then each of you will have three people helping you instead of one person helping you (yourself) and two people hurting you.

t3_1jb0wl,cbcxgu5,"And it's not a coincidence that the cultural lines of pro-life and pro-choice overlap so neatly with secular and religious, especially a religious institution that is heavily concerned with regulating sexuality, especially female sexuality. That's why abortion is a woman's rights issue; because while restricting abortion doesn't make sense from the perspective of someone genuinely trying to save fetal lives, it makes perfect sense from the perspective of someone trying to control and limit female sexuality. At a core level, the pro-life movement is a direct counter-response to growing female (especially sexual) autonomy and independence."

t3_1j00y5,cb9tnv2,"Nobody disagrees that labor behaves as a good, and has the same supply and demand curve as any other good. The debate comes because many economists believe as you do, that when an artificial price floor is imposed, demand decreases, while supply doesn't change and therefore it leads to surplus labor (in this case defined as unemployment). This makes the situation sound as though the amount of money being spent by businesses is the same no matter what the minimum wage may be, and therefore we're hiring fewer people for the same amount of money, for no reason."
t3_1j00y5,cb9tnv2,"By imposing a minimum wage, the business hires the same number of employees, but pays them more. This means that more money changes hands from businesses to employees and while a business advocate would see this as unfair, an economist knows that whenever money changes hands, it's a good thing. Yes, there may be some businesses which can't afford the pay employees minimum wage so they close, but that is not as great a negative to the economy as the higher wages of the remaining employees is a positive."
t3_1j00y5,cb9tnv2,"If the minimum wage were replaced with market wages, it would be possible to have fully employed individuals unable to even survive on their pay, and so they would have to resort to assistance programs which are supported entirely by taxes paid by those who are better employed. So while I see the minimum wage defended mostly by liberals, the logic here is actually a conservative notion - The employee is providing full time labor to the business, so why have the wealthy business owner pay for half of his employees basic livelihood while the general public shoulders the rest of the burden? The solution to that problem is to simply require the businesses to pay the full-time employees enough that the employee will not need public assistance."

However, if men don't express interest, I don't think they need to just do it anyway for the sake of it, because if no one's interested, no one would be benefited, while others would be disadvantaged. There are different types of equality, and one is equality of opportunity, so I would argue that if their policy is that if men or women ask for segregated time, they'll give it to them, then that is the kind of equality that matters."

Real choices are things like deciding that since it is impossible for any citizens to sue aluminum factories for community deaths due to the inability to determine which adjacent factories are responsible for pumping toxic fluorine gas into the local atmosphere resulting in mass deaths (aside from the fact that since nearly everyone died, it would be very difficult for any of them to actually bring the suit), that therefore as a community all existing and future aluminum factories must abide by specific rules and regulations."
