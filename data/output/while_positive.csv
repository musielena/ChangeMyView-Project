t3_29pjwk,cincqfj,"the problem here is a simple one of equivocation the primary issue is that ""authority"" in the common sense consists of people who have the capability to lie induction is based on independently confirmed observations over the course of as many trials as possible so far, we pretty much know that gravity is gravity because so far, while on the ground on planet earth, we have not observed an apple falling up a person who is considered an ""authority"" can say he's seen an apple falling up, and that's quite a different matter than whether or not apples actually fall up on a regular basis and that this fact could be independently observed and confirmed by multiple parties in multiple trials across the planet while it's entirely possible that one person may lie about apples falling up, it becomes (usually) increasingly more and more unlikely that people are lying when multiple independent sources attempt and observe the same phenomena when subject to a panel of people (peer review) who usually by and large would like nothing more than to prove someone else wrong science is self correcting... when ""I tried it a thousand times at a hundred spots across the globe and so far apples don't fall up, so I think you're full of shit"" is the response that comes from dozens or hundreds of different people, you can be fairly (although of course not 100%) assured that apples do not fall up and that gravity behaves as we more or less expect of course you are free to believe that apples fall up based on the evidence that there is a logical fallacy known as the appeal to authority and that you are effectively taking these people's word on the situation and so hundreds of people may be involved in a mass conspiracy to delude you - but I'd pretty much say that's at the very least counter productive, and at the worst kind of stupid in fact you are welcome to try your own experiments to let go of apples and see how many of them fall upwards (pending approval of funding of course), but my guess is that you will observe that they do not fall up and that if you do observe that they fall up there is one of several explanations, either you may have indeed found an anomaly (the least likely) or you are on drugs, or you simply have confirmation bias - and confirmation bias is a primary reason that things like peer review exist, because a person like yourself might not believe the status quo and may wish to try for themselves, and you are welcome to do so, and if you can provide a way for other people to also challenge the theory as you did, and also do the thing, and also see the same results, then maybe you've found an anomaly otherwise you're just crazy - of course you may simply be narcissistic and think that other people are not real or some such other oddity and so their challenges and retesting of the experiments don't count because they're all out to pull the wool over your eyes, but that would basically be psychosis if I've got my terms correct, and you would in that case be suffering from an equally problematic situation in which you think you are, but you are not, an authority"
