t3_2rnr30,cni3o83,"Consider the ""wild west."" Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according URL the murder rate was ""extraordinarily high by today's standard."" Looking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic."
t3_2rnfn0,cnhn263,"If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. Your being mugged is a statistical outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you."
t3_2rnfn0,cnhn263,"We have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you ""should"" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged. It's not necessarily ""wrong"" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal."
t3_2rnfn0,cnigfd9,"People who see it on the news and say it, especially without the full context, are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping, without realizing it. I think you're correct for the most part, but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations. I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration."
t3_2rnfn0,cnigfd9,"If someone had come in and said to my friend, ""well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do,"" then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed."
t3_2rnfn0,cnigfd9,"I'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, ""dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car."" You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth."
t3_2rnfn0,cnigfd9,"This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before. This is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhc8a5,"To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline. Not everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives, but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not. If no one studies it, then no one will be able to teach it."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"stem cells, abortion, the policies for people in vegetative states, etc.). Likewise, most people's lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine; but, for example, cutting edge businesses (e.g. tech or service start-ups) rely on previously untested reasoning, and it can be very useful to have a capable, trained set of eyes on your thought process before you pull the trigger."
t3_2rmwcd,cnhdajd,"You should ask ""what is the proper reaction?"" A person doing that is probably an asshole, but that does not mean that silencing him is a proper reaction. And I think many people would care, because nothing you say should be enough to justify my shooting you."
t3_2rkzen,cnguj0n,"Simply put, we are not ready for eugenics. Every time a proposal like this comes up I am reminded of why it's such a bad idea: not because we couldn't do it, but because we don't yet have the wisdom to do it right. You've just laid out a manifesto for making the human race more intelligent, but nowhere in it have you questioned whether or not it's a good idea."

t3_2rkzen,cngvxiy,What if we end up breeding in mental instability and don't notice until too late? I may not be a genetically enhanced superhuman but I do know that our bodies and brains are a dizzyingly complex array of interconnections and balances. The brain is particularly poorly understood.
t3_2rkzen,cngvajh,"I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement. Separating intelligence into categories is a far better way to go about it, but by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them. A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc."
t3_2rkzen,cngvajh,"A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories. The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it."
t3_2rkzen,cngvajh,This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement. 
t3_2rkzen,cngvxsd,"I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest. The ""Yeah but what if..."" thing just isn't going to fly. It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort."
t3_2rkzen,cngw4hp,"It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect. "
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"Maybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn't that a good thing? Say you're right, and most of the people who post here are incapable of actually changing their view on the subject they're bringing up (I don't believe this is the case most of the time, but just for the sake of argument). It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though."
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"I view that as intrinsically good, the search for knowledge and the refinement of your own belief system, these things make you a better, more educated and well-rounded person. You said it was a waste of time because most people's views aren't changed, or aren't changed enough, but I wouldn't say that makes it a waste of time. The mere act of getting someone to evaluate their own views and challenge them is a good thing to get in the habit of."
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"Just because OP doesn't change his mind doesn't mean someone reading the comments hasn't. I've read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I've come out with a different point of view. I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone's view was changed."

t3_2rgs7o,cngkdic,"This of course is assuming that death is an elimination of existence which is beyond what anybody truly knows. It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations. As for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning."
t3_2rexe3,cnf8xlt,"In actuality, military discounts serve as an advertisement to draw a certain demographic to your business. They're like coupons in a way, bringing in new customers and making them loyal by giving them 5-10% off, but still making you substantially more profit than if they'd not come in at all. Part of the effect of this advertising is the exclusivity."
t3_2rexe3,cnfhdgm,"And here we come back to the initial point, the discount isn't as a thank-you for something done, it is just an attempt to target a specific demographic and draw their business by making them feel like they've got an exclusive deal. If it was actually intended to repay some kind of service, it would cut into the business' bottom line, but the vast majority of discounts do not do this. "
t3_2rekjo,cnf4uxu,"I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children. I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change. I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm."
t3_2rekjo,cnf4uxu,A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world. That doesn't mean I can't try to reduce my impact on the world... but I have to accept that I will never be able to fully live within my own values. 
t3_2rcsdh,cneonwb,"But just use your common sense. Unemployment is at 90% and you're a senior politician/a ceo with influence on the government - do you A. let 90% of people die from starvation and exposure, or do you B. redistribute the money being made by the active 10% to take care of them via mechanisms like regulatory limits on automation or a guaranteed basic income? The economic collapse is plausible, but Gade's arguments are weak, not to mention contradictory, and his ""if.. then"" statements don't even follow a lot of the time - ""If the global economic system collapses, then the agricultural sector will have no further incentive to grow crops"" whut lol."

The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech, but that couldn't really be further from the truth. To understand why the board encourages to hate is to understand who goes there and it's obviously the social outcasts."
t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief. In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them. It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over."

t3_2r6a86,cncxf4c,"Therefore, Player A arbitrarily gets 1 extra option compared to Player B, and a higher chance of success. Now of course, this is a hypothetical situation, but you can probably see how this can apply to a regular game. It can add interest."
t3_2r6a86,cncxf4c,"Everything that happens is an action by either Player A or Player B. Adding items adds stuff that is done by neither Player A nor Player B, but instead done by the game. If you add a random element to a game, you'd better have a good reason."
t3_2r6a86,cncz7ep,"Whenever you do something competitively, you want that thing to have as little luck involved as possible. That's why the only gambling games done professionally / competitively are the ones where the players have the ability to apply some strategy (there are professional poker and blackjack players, but not professional roulette players or slot machine players). Smash with items off is something you can practice at, discover what is predictable, develop a strategy, and prepare for a competition."
t3_2r6a86,cncz7ep,"The inventor of basketball did not have it's current NBA incarnation in mind. And Henry Ford did not have the Ford Focus in mind when he designed the Model T, but aren't we all glad people changed things along the way so that we have what we have now?

t3_2r6a86,cncx9n7,"That is strickly personnal opinion If they give you the option of removing items it doesn't change the purpose of the game. I'm sorry but adding elements players have NO CONTROL ON makes the game extremely unfair in the case of competitive play. You are right that some items require skill to use but most of them give a big advantage to the player (trophys, pokeball, smash ball) The whole point of a competition is to match skill on an even playing field."

t3_2r5o9o,cncqcjt,"If the speaker is referring to a curve whose Y-axis represents the amount of learning that has to be done over a period of time measured by the X-axis, then ""steep"" is a perfectly sensible way to describe the shape of a curve associated with a task that is especially difficult for someone who is new to it. That may not be the curve you're imagining, but you haven't given us any reason to accept that your curve is the only one ""correctly"" described by the term ""learning curve."" Similarly, it isn't at all obvious that the phrase ""I could care less"" is an incorrect way of expressing apathy."

t3_2r4b8f,cnch3ur,"Just as you've arrived at your own point of view on experience (through your experience), events change the way we can view identical information. If someone researches loss for instance, it may be easy to develop an academic view of the subject, but that knowledge does not confer what the actual experience of loss is like, or how difficult it can be to deal with. In the same way that knowing how to lose weight doesn't often translate into success with losing weight."
t3_2r0eyf,cncjlq6,"Science has a long way before we can confidently conclude that the universe operates deterministically (i.e., there is only one physical outcome for a given action/event). As /u/PlexiglassPelican mentioned, the Consequence Argument (i.e., we do not have free will if there's an absence of genuine alternative possibilities, or the ability to do otherwise) is compelling, but it only holds water if determinism is proven true.

t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"Well, I am E. Orthodox, and to be honest if you just look at what the bible says and does not say, explicitly, there is not much useful information to be garnered. This is the deep and inherent flaw to Sola Scriptura (as well as the fact that everyone just can come up with whatever they want it to say, but thats a whole different can of worms).

Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. Trust me, when you play a character who's a lot more of an asshole but who's a really determined asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it's worth something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience. It's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with that story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it didn't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that's your ending for you. Shitty failure Shepard's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she'd burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left. To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"Losing all the choices at the end made sense , this time, in the context of her experiences. Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough, but I'd say that the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it is there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that's screwed up the whole way. I don't think of it as me killing of those characters off, it's whatever Shepard I'm playing in that particular runthrough that's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"Edit: Also, OP, if you're complaining that people who let companions die miss out on content later in the game, you should consider that as a person who played through ME several times (these weren't actually my only Shepards, I have also tried every romance because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), I've actually experienced far more of it than you have. The 'but you see less of it if you do this other route' ignores that you can just play the game again . "
t3_2qrlmm,cn8va27,"Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad. That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad? Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad."
t3_2qrlmm,cn8va27,"Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system.

Second, let's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation."
t3_2qrlmm,cn8va27,"In short, my two points were: 1. We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory). 2."

t3_2qqxoy,cn8oez8,"While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself, and in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier. Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process (which I believe you've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well (if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM). Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior."
t3_2qqxoy,cn8oez8,"Take for instance being ""taken by the holy spirit"". From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder."

If you limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women, then maybe you're right, but then again who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?

What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent?"
t3_2qmhw7,cn7hxwe,"Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as ""whoring""?

So anyways, my point - I think you have it backwards."
t3_2lo786,clwsiei,"Having a quality actor on set gives you options as a filmmaker, because they can adapt, give you new ideas, play a scene big to fill a room you didn't have the budget to set dress, play it close to let you cover with a closeup for a matching action you couldn't get yesterday, solve a script problem with a look or a physical affectation, the list goes on and on. I'm rambling, but this is it - as a low-tier professional filmmaker who usually has a budget handed down to him, there is no camera, light, location support or extra asset worth more to me than a good actor. I can say this definitively because usually talent is the first thing cut from my budgets (because you are not the first person with this idea - and business people don't like things that can't be quantified), so I have more than enough experience with bad or mediocre acting and what it can do to a production."

It's not a perfect analogy, but I work in TV, and you tend to hear a lot of similar alarmist statements that are frankly, baseless. While it's true ratings have decreased overall with over-saturation of television channels and increase of choices in programs to watch, this only means salespeople and advertisers have to get more creative."

Since so many shows get the same numbers but some get more hype than others, a salesperson has to convince advertisers why their show might fit the client better. This is why you see ads for haunted houses and upcoming horror movies when you turn on an episode of American Horror Story and ads for musicals and headphones when you're watching Glee."
t3_2jd1e2,clal24g,This is why you see ads for haunted houses and upcoming horror movies when you turn on an episode of American Horror Story and ads for musicals and headphones when you're watching Glee. Sure you have your filler ads by the big companies that drop money just to be included in whatever program but salespeople at least at a local level have gotten a lot more creative recently with how they pitch shows to prospective advertisers. Ads are a lot more targeted to the demographics that view the shows the ads play on.

t3_2jalt8,clawz3s,"In the past, the possible objects to call ""Property"" were actual physical objects, and so society codified certain ethics based around the owning of these objects.

t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,"2. My favored argument, but controversial because of its implications. I argue that as you have said, human life begins at conception."
t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,"We know it is human because the genetic code cannot be argued to be that of any other species, and indeed is an individual of the species own unique genetic code. even identical twins have very very slight differences in their genetic codes, on the order of a few base pairs, but different no less. so that satisfies the human part ."
t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,Their concepts have application for all biology however. I will note that there is some disagreement about these definitions but nevertheless they serve as a great/solid foudation upon which to build our ideas of life. Life must satisfy the following conditions in almost every case: 1. composed of cell/cells 2. organizatoin (think organs/organelles) 3. engage in metabolism (energy use) 4.

I mean there have been a lot of URL of simple amino acids and other organic molecules in space but as of yet nothing more evolved that would lead us to be certain of extraterrestrial life. For those reasons when It comes to extraterrestrial life I believe our best answer would be: ""THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."""

This is because we not only have the right to speak, but the right to be exposed to outside ideas we don't agree with, to challenge the ones we to ( kinda paraphrasing hitchens here, but i won't be saying it as well as he did) so the ""bad"" is not the holocaust denier which many feel is bad, but the restricting of that thought to exist. Without it, there is no contrast to see the other ideas in context."

t3_2iu5ia,cl8r2er,"A good example is how our bill of rights differs from the french declaration of human rights. The men who founded America, and the men who started and were players in the french revolution, all looked to Montesquieu, Voltaire, Hume, etc.. but were not always in line with what ""rights"" were, and it was up to much debate. To carry it further, you have people like Jean Paul Marat, and later Blanqui, and onward to Karl Marx, yes Marx, which come from the European tradition rooted in the french enlightenment, and french libertarianism."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r2t3,"5.See here is where you suddenly bring in state of nature, and again, not putting it into context to how that system works.

They can, this absolved them from legal action, but certainly not social action. You have every right to call out an asshole as an asshole and not buy shit from them for being discriminatory."

t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"so if shits all misspelled or theres words out of place, or even rants that go off topic I apologize. 13.there are a few who view consumption of marijuana as immoral,but should not be illegal, and many with abortion ( lefty libertarians ) who think immoral but not illegal. The main issue here is the race one is the most covered and discussed one because it makes the best headlines and is a topic people get worked up over."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"As far as Dr. Ron Paul he believed that life starts at conception, so if its a human life, then its got rights, so that argument is his against abortion, where are other libertarians who get behind the ideas in Mcfall vs Shimp where you cannot be forced to give parts of your body to save others... There is a much older case of that but damned if i cant remember or find it, but the idea that you can't be forced to save someones life at the expense of yours. Also again being a libertarian is about the worldview more than necessarily a defined political system, that world view is to support and defined rights, and allow individual people and society to evolve without coercion derailing its progression."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"Also your hanging on Ron Paul as the libertarian of choice here, and he's not, hes a republican. ( i did support him, not because i believed 100% of what he said though, I had many disagreements with his platform, but it was the lesser of evils i suppose.) I mean more true to what republicans should be by definition of the word, as republican little ""r"" is a political philosophy and with a big ""R"" is a brand name fore a political party that is not republican or anything else other than lunacy, ""D""emocrats are also not really ""d""emocrats."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"There is a believe that if an idea is good enough that it stands on its own.

It was continued in France, and well hati had a uprising!"
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"In a language of the founding fathers, truths that are self evident. Libertarianism is politics, but its also process. The process is defining rights, and determining when they are infringed."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"Racism is one, because libertarians don't support the government punishing racist speech and such, its spun as being pro-racist. It's not, it's not saying that socially their shouldn't be an outcry, but that unless rights are infringed, then legally there is not an issue. Certainly there is a social one though."
t3_2isiv7,cl525xl,"Everyone in a country would be there on a recognized legal status and be able to participate in the democratic process to various degrees (either getting to vote, or be a candidate in, elections) if they are in the country permanently. However if we do have immigrants who for some reason want to permanently reside in the country but are incapable of passing a test on civics I do not think it is appropriate to give them the vote. This however would be a very rare case as people allowed to immigrate should be more than intelligent enough to pass the citizenship test."

Now, if a guy slaps you with his dick, you don't have the word to describe what just happened, but that doesn't make your face any less dick-slapped. For a more real life example, after a senator in Arizona got shot, there were people who were saying that we should remove ""violent words"" from school curriculum, the media, and the English language."

t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"Simply calling a Turk and a Yazidi from Iran an 'Iranian' would be reducing their identities to a level that even the two people in question would object to.

I think most people feel the same way about their ethnic make-up."
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"Not acknowledging this because it highlights that there are differences between mankind might avoid any possibility of discrimination (can't discriminate against people who are different if no one is different!) but it is a weak-willed way to look at the world. It attempts to remove the impediment to accepting everyone equally for who they are by denying that there should be any challenge to accepting others who are different, because no 'different' people exist."
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"If it is merely your personal view on how you'd like to treat others - okay, that's certainly one way to do it. But rather than ignoring the fact that we are different because we've developed different attributes because of a different heritage isn't really the way I'd prefer to go. I'd rather reckon someone who who they are - isn't it nobler to accept them for that?"
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"Your skin is the largest organ of the body, covering most of your exterior, which makes it even easier to identify someone by this trait.

But if you aced the first test and subsequently forgot all that info for the final, you won't have that retention you're talking about and you may not do well on the final, but you'll still have a good grade on the first exam.

So is it tribalism?"

Circling back to your time = money scenario, this expanded worldview allows you to retain your instilled sense of the value of time, but can show you that you are ""Wasting your time"" by only considering one life path, even if there are others that could lead to a higher earning potential and better enjoyment of life. Additionally, ask anyone in the business world about how EVERYTHING works, and they will all tell you that personal connections are hugely important."

Windows 8 was clearly designed around tablets, which is fine , but what works for tablets for UI design doesn't translate to mouse and keyboard.

t3_2hevmr,cks71oj,"Ultimately I agree with you, but rather than dismiss the ""opportunity"" vs ""outcome"" nomenclature, I think it is more useful to embrace both concepts and talk about how they are invariably linked and the solution has to be a weighted optimization somewhere between them. Yes, but the ambiguity you suggest is exactly why there can never be a ""correct"" answer. This is an optimization problem with a moving target, imperfect measurement, and disagreement over the relative weights of metrics to be balanced in the optimizations."

If you were popped into existence somewhere in society, but don't know where you'll show up (race, sex, social status, wealth), what rules would you put in place. This consideration goes for everything from law to economic policy to social policy."
t3_2hevmr,cks71oj,"After decades of understanding complex system behaviour, I am convinced (by the mathematics and dynamics of system behaviour) that the optimization must be some form of compromise that involves the equivalent of constantly re-leveling the field and diminishing returns on scores, meaning each metaphorical ""goal"" is worth less and less the more you score. (Your score goes up, but smaller amounts each time.) This translates in reality to things that result in some re-distributions (progressive taxes for social services and safety nets), perhaps some affirmative action style promotion -- but only in cases where under-representation actually affects the future of the group under-represented (""tilt of field""), and other forms of equalizing outcomes."

t3_2hcsbm,ckrh8qs,"How about ice hockey? Basically all of the things you mentioned apply just as well to hockey as they do to football, but without nearly as many stoppages of play. And every player must exhibit a good combination of those traits in order to be successful, rather than just one or two."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrh8qs,"And every player must exhibit a good combination of those traits in order to be successful, rather than just one or two. Granted, there is still specialization, but if a player is great at hitting but can't catch up to anyone to hit them, they aren't very useful. Also, you need better reaction times to play hockey than football, especially as a goalie."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrl5p9,"So, in my opinion at least, if football is chess, hockey is speed chess. It's a bit harder to find good examples of strategy on YouTube, because hockey's highlight reels tend to focus on other skills like speed and coordination, but it still plays a huge role in the course of a game. When one team is in the offensive zone (trying to score,) they need to maintain control of the puck while they set up opportunities for themselves."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrl5p9,"Sometimes things happen so quickly, there isn't enough time to actually set up - usually on turnovers or pucks that bounce oddly.

It's really easy to focus on the puck here, but watch the clip three times, and watch a different player each time."

I think skill is the most difficult to quantify, but what I will say is that boxing, unlike football requires a wide variety of skills, footwork, form, endurance, strength, etc, while football players are more specialized. I think that this shows that even if American football has slightly more skill, the lack of strategic depth and lower athleticism make boxing a far superior sport based on the criteria you've given."

The problem with the historical examples you raise is that they are isolated; one industry disappears, but a new one replaces it, something you yourself noted.

t3_2h6ar3,ckps8kn,"Because like you noted, when the only people in any sort of economically beneficial position own the means of production, everyone else suffers. We're slowly eroding the social safety net in this country and actively trying to reduce the amount of taxes corporations and wealthy individuals pay, which is the equivalent of a river that suddenly loses its' headwaters; the output keeps going until the system is drained, but with no input suddenly only the people at the mouth of the river have any water. Finally, with how the political system in this country is favoring oligopolies, monopolies, and anti competitive networks of all kinds, there's no longer any reason for businesses to compete to lower costs because costs of production have gone down."

t3_2gy3lp,cknmcme,"If asked to list things I don't ever want to do ever abortion would be the first on that list. So to do my best to make sure I won't have to, I am careful in how I have sex to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, so that if something happens and I do wind up pregnant I know I did everything I could to prevent needing one, but if I do need one, I will use it. I do not think abortion should be used as a birth control method, it should be a last resort kind of thing."
t3_2gy3lp,cknmcme,"I have known people who don't use protection of any kind, and just have multiple abortions, I do not agree with that, it actually makes me cringe. It is a right if you need it, but people need to be more responsible in trying to make sure you don't need it. "

t3_2gy3lp,cknodzx,"But if I donate a kidney there area a lot of negative side effects of organ donation, surgery, recovery time etc. I can opt to say no, and people wouldn't think I'm awesome but they wouldn't imply I'm murdering her. This relates to what we are talking about, because I find out I'm pregnant and what this fetus is doing is asking to use multiple of my organs (where my sister is only asking to use one of my organs) to keep itself alive."

For example, I'm mixed (won't say the exact mix to protect my anonymity, but it's a somewhat complicated mixture). I've been mistaken for all sorts of things, though typically people think I'm latino or middle eastern (I'm neither)."
t3_2gutfw,ckmsso5,"There are no racially homogenous countries. My guess is that most people in North America would call them Asians, but they're all quite different from Chinese and Indians (though there are many Indians in Indonesia).

t3_2gutfw,ckmpz17,"Multicultural is a useless identifier. I am mixed, half Latino and half Caucasian, but referring to myself as multicultural would put me in the same category as Barack Obama, Tiger Woods, or Hannah Simone.

t3_2gq5zo,cklin03,"If it's supposed to be an answer, it's an incomplete one. Degrees might signal a few qualities, but it's also a very good way for professions to maintain some control over the pool of people offering similar services vis-a-vis demand for those services.

t3_2glozx,ckkahw7,"For example, consider firefighters that run into a burning, collapsing building in order to save people. You could say that they want the 'good feeling' of rescuing people, but they do it with the understanding that there's a substantial chance they could be killed.

You could argue that I want to have the good feeling of having an extra penny or want to avoid the bad feeling of carrying around loose change, but the truth is I feel entirely neutral and any change for the good or bad is so insubstantial as to be not worth mention. So why do I do it?"
t3_2gliyk,ckk9blv,"This is very prevalent in America, from what I've seen. People know very little about nuclear power, but they know nuclear bombs almost ended the world. A big reason that we're not switching to nuclear power is cost."
t3_2gliyk,ckk9blv,"We don't use them more often because it's scary, expensive and too many people depend on fossil fuels to make their living. So yes, we probably should use nuclear power more openly, but it's going to be a very slow process to get to that point because of how depedant we've become on fossil fuels and how nuclear power works, right now. These are some of the reasons that, right now , we can't."
t3_2gliyk,ckkaypu,"It has always been subsidized, in some cases 100% subsidized, by states interested in the potential of nuclear power. There was some hope that eventually costs would decline and it would be viable on its own (this has happened in the solar industry), but no such luck. Remember thay even though there have only been 3 major nuclear disasters, there are only about 400 nuclear power plants worldwide."
t3_2gliyk,ckkaypu,"Remember thay even though there have only been 3 major nuclear disasters, there are only about 400 nuclear power plants worldwide. That suggests the rate of failure of nuclear power plants is a bit lower than 1%, but that is misleading because many of those plants are relatively new (I think about half built since Chernobyl), so the true rate could be as high as 2-5%. But even a 1% rate is horrendous because, as we have known since Chernobyl, the consequences of a meltdown can be stupendously bad."
t3_2gliyk,ckkaypu,"The area around it has been abandoned and returned to wilderness. The nuclear industry's argument was that that sort of think might happen in Russia or a third-world country, but (minus growing pains like Three Mile Island) Western engineering and safety standards would keep us safe. Fukushima disproved that assertion: no country has more technical and industrial expertise with nuclear than Japan, and their safety standards failed to withstand extreme events."
t3_2gliyk,ckkaypu,"Therefore, there are strong reasons to retrench on nuclear power: definitely in cases where the reactor hasn't been built yet, possibly in cases where some of the sunk costs have already been lost. You say that nuclear power functions normally under the same conditions as other power plants, but you seem to be neglecting that when a coal, solar, wind, or hydro plant malfunctions, you lose power but you don't have nuclear contamination, endless clean-up costs, and cancer to worry about. (And to my friends with the downvotes, maybe you would be more happy discussing nuclear energy on /r/politics ? )"

t3_2giql7,ckkk3rl,"But at the end of the day, its my brain which does the thinking and makes me act. Physical attraction is merely a more primitive way by which a man identified a partner who will give him the best offsprings, but almost all people in the world marry based on the rational basis, they marry and are attracted towards a person who would give them the most long term happiness. Also btw, on a sidenote, I wouldn't ignore the person raising the potential of 'depression'."

First of all, recognize that when an ISP ""offers"" 25 Mbps service, that's a maximum -- there may be times when you can actually get 25 Mbps (when, for example, nobody else is using their network), but because they over-subscribe their service, you might be down at 5 Mbps or worse during peak times.

t3_2fgw85,ck96vg6,"To be clear: there is a difference between urgency and speed. I believe you have an pressing need to try and sort this out, but I don't not believe you should feel rushed to do so. I think that's a pretty astute observation for what it feels like to have depression."
t3_2fgw85,ck96vg6,"That is, the preoccupation of why the hell I should care. People without depression don't really think that way -- I mean, a lot of folks aren't above questioning purpose or motivations of course, but it's not an all consuming mindset. In other words, the need to have your ""shit together"" on the macro sense is not a prerequisite for daily functioning."
t3_2fgw85,ck96vg6,"In other words, the need to have your ""shit together"" on the macro sense is not a prerequisite for daily functioning. It's not to say you should wander through life absent of considering such things, but the only way you'll ever really have that macro purpose is if you decide that for yourself. You make your own meaning in life."
t3_2fgshm,ck9f5l1,"Calling depression a character flaw, to the contrary, is not only ineffective it is actively counterproductive, and will result only in more depression. I'll agree with you that it's true that both of these things are ""brain chemistry"" (in a sense... chemistry is kind of a misleading term here, but I'll take it as you mean it... electrochemistry is ultimately all physics, which doesn't change the argument). So... what's the advantage of calling one of these things a ""disease"" vs. a ""character flaw""?"
t3_2fgshm,ck9f5l1,"Get real. That's not a cure, it's another disease... and someone on meth might be more active , but they won't accomplish any more of what we want people to accomplish.). However, laziness can be impacted by the incentives that we give to a person."
t3_2fgshm,ck9f5l1,"Almost all that we do with moral systems are tricks to deal with things that we don't have other good ways to deal with, in order to gain advantages for society. It absolutely makes sense to consider laziness a character flaw, but not depression. The former is effective in disincentivizing laziness and causing change in the person in a way that nothing else is."

t3_2fduqy,ck8t6he,"As you said, you grew up where it was taboo- being told over and over that your body is dirty and that doing it is wrong... You are conditioned to that response, that is why it happens.

Animals do it for the same reason we do, it feels good, but there are also other more scientific reasons as to why masturbation can be good for us. Firstly the obvious, it helps you sleep- reduces stress- and all sorts of stuff which is beneficial for coping with day to day life."
t3_2fduqy,ck8t6he,"The thing is, masturbation and fapping isn't your problem, it is the guilt and shame you feel which makes you feel the whole world is against you. Imagine you were meeting up with someone for a date, you didn't hit it off so it turned sour and you went home alone (ironically, I am sure that would be the perfect time to masturbate, but this isn't the point of this example). But lets have a look at what caused that."
t3_2fduqy,ck8t6he,"(stolen without guilt from a random forum, since I don't believe in or understand that astrology shit). You go to that date dismissing what your friend said, but during the night you notice little things that remind you of his words. Because of this you obsess over them, act differently then you otherwise would and cause the night to end in ruin without even realizing it."
t3_2fduqy,ck8t6he,"Meanwhile if you went on the date without hearing this, you would have just accepted that things were going great without a second thought. Maybe either way the date would have ended badly, maybe it wouldn't- but being told or not being told would be a defining factor Look man, I know it is hard to overcome indoctrination, overcome the feeling that your body is dirty- Hell. If you have a fetish for something you dislike it works the same way."

In reality there was no physical relationship between their actions and the production of the food, but they had nonetheless come to believe there was a causal relationship and so they would perform the actions whenever they were near feeding time in order to make the food come. This is a form of cognitive bias and it is found in humans as well as pigeons."
t3_2fduqy,ck8agrx,"So because of your upbringing which has led to your irrational guilt over an act which is completely normal, healthy, and nothing to be remotely guilty over, your mind desperately tries to reach out and look for patterns.

In reality there is no connection between either the negative or the positive."

t3_2fd87u,ck83yle,"In my mind, the crowd that justifies the viewing of the recent leaked photos is the same crowd that does not worry or care about photos of women posted without their consent. I think the comparison between these two things is fair, but where we differ is that I don't believe we've decided as a society that we don't care about photos posted without consent, celeb or no. As with many issues, society as a whole tends to notice what's going on when it pertains to the famous."

t3_2fatey,ck7nuyn,"I seem to remember Reddit making a fuss about numerous Chinese citizens who disregarded a dead child on the street or some struggling bystander or something. It may seem horrible and completely selfish to westerners, but it makes more sense when you first consider that their culture is not big on public interaction and that they likely perceived it as some sort of scam waiting to happen (which it often is over there). I guess what I'm getting at is that, to judge a person's moral character, you must first make a lot of observations about their life (including the superficial details) and try to understand how that would impact them (i.e; make judgments)."

This is an issue the Government runs into, as well, as they provide money for one group of individuals who need it, but another group of individuals receives nothing. They need to lobby to get their demographic recognized and so forth."
t3_2f8s0s,ck7d64v,"They need to lobby to get their demographic recognized and so forth. A mere comparison, though 100% different but follows the same logic, is that if police officers demand a raise and get it, then EMS workers may request one, then firefighters, etc. Government is one giant massive pot all taxes go into and then people take from - and more people want to take than want to give."
t3_2f8s0s,ck7d64v,"This lack of caring to give, in my opinion, stems from the amount of waste. Having Government welfare is good, in theory, like any charity helping people, but it's tied with military spending, political bias and misrepresentation and scandals, etc. How do I know my money goes to welfare?"
t3_2f8s0s,ck7d64v,"Well, how do we know it goes to the charity? The same answer for both but for charity, once you learn your money isn't going where you thought, you can cease payment. You can't with Government, you are stuck unless someone changes the policies which takes years and years."

I know it's easy for me to sit there and suggest we need more jobs and snapping my fingers doesn't make it happen, but I am in the school of thought that actually suggests that this welfare, the idea of ""forced help,"" is what actually contributes to the issues rather than alleviates them. By freeing society up, by allowing people to spend less on taxes (in America, people spend 30-40% on taxes - they revolted when they paid 1-2% during a little Tea Party), one allows people to keep what they earn and demand less while sustaining themselves."

t3_2f5k1m,ck65w9s,"Is this wrong? I know that piracy is a hotly debated topic as well, but I think it does highlight the issue of ownership. Just because someone else stole the album, does this mean that you now have the right to listen to it?"

I'd be more willing to believe you if we were talking about serial killers, but I think the offender in this case may be a little more relatable...unless you're talking about the worst, most brutal rape involving significant bodily harm beyond penetration. So I guess it depends on how you'd define ""rape"" -- if you include every time a woman submits to sex against her desire because of an imbalanced power dynamic in our male-centric culture, yeah, you can definitely teach that out of the culture, though granted it would be a long uphill battle."
t3_2f1tka,ck53vic,"If you accept a different definition of rape--one that stems from a deep-rooted power imbalance between men and women--I think it's easier to imagine that being removed from the culture (slowly, yes) without demonizing a large group of innocent people.

There is a much higher correlation between the pursuit of self interest and income."
t3_2e3t22,cjvs6w2,"This political outcome could mean the rich get more overall income so they gain overall wealth while paying more taxes so also gaining more political power.

t3_2e3t22,cjvs6w2,"Also, this might create other types of minority groups. The rich might not favor policies hurting the poor directly, but it seems plausible that rich people would tend to be in a certain age range, and then might start targeting politically powerless groups (18-25) for some kind of discrimination.

I mostly ended up spending my summers at the local pool, because I loved swimming so much, but there were also some nearby parks and fields that I could have spent my time in. As I got older, I spent most of my time at the high school which was within walking distance (about a 1/4 mile)."

I do agree with you that rural environments provide much better situations for children than the suburbs do, but I think that you are underestimating the access to some of these things that some suburbs provide. In the house I currently live in (still very much suburbs), it backs to woods and a small creek."
t3_2e1fah,cjv86o4,"A short walk away is a local park with more developed woods (read, larger uninterrupted acreage) and a thriving stream system.

t3_2e1fah,cjv86o4,"As for the things the rural kids you know learned how to do, I did learn most of those while growing up. I built structures with my dad, helped my mom in our vegetable garden (not livestock, but a similar usefulness of the skill), and I learned how to shoot through my high school on a competitive team (I have been to competitions recently where I am competing against mostly rural people who grew up shooting and hunting, and I beat them all). Where I am, there are more youth athletic programs than I know what to do with, and I would be hard pressed to find someone who didn't do any growing up."

t3_2dwpux,cjtyp9n,"Well, as you mention, I think being forced is the crucial point. Not only because it would likely make it easier to exclude and judge them (after all, it's possible that they could lie and blend in with your other coworkers), but because they simply don't have the choice. In a lot of ways, making the free choice to abstain from alcohol could be empowering-- you know what's good for you and you are willing to separate yourself from the social pressure in order to do what's good for you."
t3_2dwpux,cjtyp9n,"So, while I certainly agree that consuming alcohol isn't necessary for social interaction, it's also true that there are some social expectations for people to drink occasionally. And while many people are certainly capable of making the difficult but empowering choice to abstain, to force people to not drink is to A) strip them of the ability to make this potentially empowering choice, B) force them to abstain from something that, if done in moderation, will possibly have a net positive effect on their life, and C) label them as people incapable of making the choice and ostracizing them from normal society. "
t3_2dwpux,cju22i0,"And that is the ostracizing element. You're not going to have a tough time integrating back into society because you can't own a gun, but you may have a tough time if you can't drink.

t3_2dwpux,cju22i0,"It's not just that they don't drink, it's that they can't drink. No one would feel uncomfortable drinking around someone who chooses not to drink, but to drink around someone who may well want to drink and can't would make a lot of people uncomfortable, I think. Sure, it's possible for the person to handle the restriction gracefully, and laugh about it, continue to go out sober, etc."

t3_2dqwmd,cjs5kz7,"Generally, when you are in a discriminated against minority, you've got two choices: try to blend in or take ownership of the stereotype. There's nothing wrong at all with you just being you, and wanting your sexual preference to be treated no different than being left handed - you're different than the majority, and you do things a little differently than they do, but no big deal.

t3_2dqwmd,cjs6dmm,The thing is that when a straight person is annoying they are seen as an annoying person not as an annoying straight person. That's the nature of discrimination that people only associate a group with the most perceived negative attributes of that group.

t3_2dn11e,cjrb1dq,"I think in certain narrow circumstances (e.g. professional peers of similar standing) it is appropriate and useful to compare yourself to others, but most of the time it isn't. I feel this is different from what you said in your OP."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"Let's say now that one day you wake up to find Bob got a job or got a raise at his job, found a hot girlfriend, got a record deal with BMI/RCA/whatever and won the lottery. Additionally you happen to know that Bob is not very good at music and they're just going to auto tune him, that Bob is not very good at his job but his boss is his Uncle and that he probably plans to waste all his money in Vegas. At one point you may have felt a friendly competitive nature in relation to Bob, and even prided yourself on the idea that you were ever so slightly better off than Bob, or at least felt like he was someone helping you feel driven to succeed by making sure you were at least on a competitive level with him."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"It may now seem unfair and impossible to accomplish anything in life and the friendly competitive drive may turn to depression and despair, even though you yourself, really have not changed. Sure this story is contrived and extreme, but the result, sooner or later of almost any type of self comparison situation is still pretty much the same or at least runs a high risk of seeing this type of outcome. While it's important to be realistic about your skills and talents and improving them, even a single small item in the area of ""how good at music"" you are in comparison to someone else can be a slippery slope leading to other implicit comparisons."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"I'd say playing fast (which is probably one of the primary ways most musicians measure themselves) is about the worst measure of the skill of a musician, and that playing expressively is what counts. Of course it's only natural to pursue advanced precision and speed if your desired occupation is ""musician"" but really there are far more important skills such as ability to compose, to work on demand with others, to take direction, to learn charts to listen and read and fill in the gaps in a tasty manner without making things muddy or stepping on other people's toes. As a musician myself, I would always prefer to play with someone who can just listen and without me saying anything add something really groovy to the sound rather than someone who can play fast."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"You could take a general survey of how fast, on average, all the best players can play, and then stop comparing yourself to anyone and instead set goals for yourself on where you want to go, only in relation to yourself and a plain number (in BPM) rather than in comparison to any other specific people. Chances are, you'll never play as fast as Frank Gambale or Jan Hammer - but you can probably play fast enough for any other person to think you can play as fast as you need to. Heck, without even bothering to go watch/listen to other players, you can probably already figure out a BPM target on your own."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"Heck, without even bothering to go watch/listen to other players, you can probably already figure out a BPM target on your own. Or you could consult some complex classical scores by long since dead people to whom you can't really compare your persons, but you can estimate how fast Rachmaninoff's compositions were intended to be played, and then generate a rough goal for yourself in relation to yourself instead of in relation to other people. There's also the issue of losing sight of why you like music in the first place, what really moves you, and when you've got a good firm hold on what you like and care about and want to hear and when you play what you want to hear and stop worrying about whether you sound like so-and-so, then and only then, you'll be making the best music you can."
t3_2dn11e,cjrjl9x,"Much better would be to gauge people's reactions to your music and how much they like it, than to try to measure yourself in comparison to someone else. Much better would be to set reasonable personal goals based on what you already know about playing music and the difficulty involved and the skill level you wish to achieve, but not in relation to others, only yourself. Much better would be to study the sounds you hear that you like, without reference to the people - analyze why you like that, what it's made of, and then incorporate it in to your own playing because you like it not because of an (IMO misguided) idea that that the person who played it is much better than you or that the person who played it played it fast."

This was amply demonstrated by the German occupation of Belgium a century ago at the beginning of World War One."
t3_2dfvv8,cjp4zw9,"Lets say you treat your minions badly already. In that case even small rewards are very effective, but punishments tend to be lost amid the general crappy treatment. There are few methods for effective punishment in that scenario, and punishment is absolutely necessary."
t3_2dfvv8,cjp4zw9,"I would argue that these cases should not be taken as occurring in a vacuum. This indicates that things like casual torture, demotions, and the like are meted out for relatively minor offenses and the manager on scene has little recourse but go for the big one.

In the case of the Shredder he is stepping into a heritage and tradition of cruelty, previous masters set a tone and the resetting of the balance between reward and punishment would threaten his legitimacy power as successor."

t3_2df7cg,cjoxxyu,"Since you're not all living in a community together, it teaches actual active friendship where you have to track them down, make plans and really desire that person in your life.

t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"First of all, you're making your position seem much less on the fringe than it really is. Again, believing in utilitarianism broadly (as many respected philosophers do) does not commit us to believing that it's morally right to strap people into the experience machine without their consent, just as it doesn't commit us to believing that doctors ought to cut open their healthy check-up patients to distribute their organs. Furthermore, if there's really no reason to believe that (your version of) utilitarianism is true, then, well, why do you subscribe to it as a theory of normative ethics?"
t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"There are competing theories of normative ethics around, so why did you land on utilitarianism? No, but I don't study normative ethics. My reasons for believing in any theory of normative ethics are going to be like my reasons for believing in any kind of scientific claim--all else being equal, I defer to the experts in the field."

Okay, that's not something that most of the experts in the field of ethics believe, but grant that it's true. In that case, your view that you want changed amounts to nothing more than ""According to one bizarre theory of ethics that no one takes seriously, kidnapping someone and forcibly connecting them to the experience machine is morally justified."""

t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"If a theory is going to throw our very strong intuitions out the window, it should some justification behind it. We really did have good reason to be suspicious of quantum mechanics, but it turned out that quantum mechanics did indeed have good justification behind it, so we abandoned our intuitions. For this parallel to go through, we need some justification for your version of utilitarianism, and we have literally none whatsoever."
t3_2d8gej,cjnahke,"For this parallel to go through, we need some justification for your version of utilitarianism, and we have literally none whatsoever. Second, I'm getting a little out of my depth here, but I think morality in particular demands some appeal to intuition, inasmuch as our intuitions kind of shape what the conceptual content of morality is. For instance, if we had some moral theory worked out than turned out to entail normative claims like ""It's wrong to wear white after Labor Day,"" I think that in itself would give us good reason to doubt the theory, inasmuch as I think our reaction to that would just be to kind of tilt our heads and say that that kind of rule is not what we're talking about when we talk about morality."
t3_2d8gej,cjo8yiz,"I don't have any particular belief about normative ethics. I guess I have deontological intuitions, but I haven't studied the subject near enough to be able to say that one theory is probably right. At any rate, I really think that this exchange should be enough to change your view, inasmuch as you have admitted you have quite literally no reason to hold the view you hold."
t3_2d8gej,cjo8yiz,"This is irrelevant. I'm not claiming to have a great answer for the is-ought problem, but the point of the is-ought problem is not that it's impossible to make normative claims, only that it's impossible to derive them from purely descriptive claims. I'm not deriving any normative claims from purely descriptive claims, so there's no problem."
t3_2d8gej,cjo8yiz,"See? Obviously science and normative ethics are different, but the arguments here work exactly the same way, and no crossing from is to ought is necessary. I'm not saying that my scientific beliefs lead to my normative beliefs, if that's what you thought."

I'm not sure how it works in Germany, but in the US, there tend to be two kinds of dubs: the kind where all of the roles are dubbed by professional voiceover artists, and the kind where most of the main roles are dubbed by well-known English-speaking actors who usually don't have much experience doing voiceover work. The dubs that use professional voiceover actors usually sound better."

t3_2brzwb,cj8hzbv,"This is clearly incomplete or wrong when we look at the evidence. We are whole, yes, but we are also part of a hierarchy. Koestler coined the term holon for this, see ""*Janus*""."
t3_2brzwb,cj8hzbv,"Yet the current paradigm of individual consciousness is so pervasive that we do not even see these other states, or we dismiss them as hallucinatory. None of this is conclusive proof, but a case can be made that consciousness is not just a brain attribute, and the fact that we have not found it in the brain so far is a clue that we are looking in the wrong place. Even when we find clues, they may only represent signals in the TV set."
t3_2brzmq,cj8bm67,"They're not a flaw, they're entirely logical. You have explained your own struggle with emotional control, but it doesn't logically follow that everyone else struggles with it too or that emotionally-guided decisions are automatically bad. Emotions are actually quite logical."
t3_2brzmq,cj8ba9r,"Emotions may often cloud are judgement, but they also give value to life. I would argue that emotions aren't a flaw in humanity, but they instead make humanity what it is. Without any emotion, most people would have no reason to live, no reason to procreate, and no reason to come up with ideas."
t3_2brzmq,cj8ba9r,"If this were to happen, surely mankind would stagnate and be in a much worse place than in a society with emotions? Emotions may often cloud are judgement, but they also give value to life. "
t3_2bqtzl,cj80j9s,"As for the NFL they have been coming down hard on other behaviors. Ben Roethlisberger was initially suspended for 6 games for sexual harassment that he wasn't even formally charged with (Rice was not only charged but the charges were upgraded), Josh Gordon for an entire season for marijuana, and URL was suspended for 4 games for domestic assault. So a 2 game suspension seems pretty weak when compared to other suspensions and when Goodell is supposed to be getting tough on outside problems then it really seems weak."
t3_2bqdam,cj828mm,"While you can throw any number of hypothetical factors into the situation, pregnancy is preventable and I don't think that sudden, unexpected unemployment is likely for most people. I may be wrong on that, but for the sake of argument, let's assume this individual will have $300/month to put towards paying down this debt for the foreseeable future. Snowball Method- $179/month toward $5,000 debt with 5% APR $121/month toward $10,000 debt with 8% APR After 30 months you will have paid off the smaller debt with a total of $5,326.83 and paid $3,630 toward the larger debt and still owe $8,202.16 at 8% APR."
t3_2bqdam,cj86g7o,"If someone is having motivation issues, I would definitely recommend consolidation as it forces you to at least continue making healthy decisions. I hate to be a broken record, but consolidation fits this scenario much better. More on this later, but that's crossing the line into irresponsibility."
t3_2bqdam,cj86g7o,"I hate to be a broken record, but consolidation fits this scenario much better. More on this later, but that's crossing the line into irresponsibility. If you can only afford to pay $500 per month, you're just re-visiting the bad habits that brought you into debt if you're ""scraping up"" another ~$100 to ""finish off"" a debt, instead of just waiting until next month to mop it up and keeping your budget responsible."
t3_2bqdam,cj86g7o,"It's an irresponsible allocation of funds. I mean, it's not buying an 80-inch TV or trading in a car for a more expensive lease when they're already in huge debt, but it is a misuse of available money none-the-less. To put it bluntly, if you have $500 free to spend this month, and you decide to pay down a 3% APR car loan which $1000 left on it instead of lowering a $10,000 25% interest credit card debt... that's fiscally irresponsible."

When you have a female character, however, who is part of the plot, who has a name, and as such is not supposed to be considered an obstacle to victory, but instead an ally, she really ought to have some level of agency. Both sets of objectifications are crappy to me, and I'll turn off a game or film if there's too much of either."
t3_2bo66v,cj791co,"Firstly, ID is just code for christian Creationism.

You can interpret the Big Bang in any religious way that you personally choose."
t3_2bo66v,cj79hlu,"But to try to give it the same mantle as the big bang is to try to give ID this scientificness that it doesn't have. ID is simply a religious belief, which is fine, but it doesn't get to hang out with science. "

Generally I'm not opposed to separate sports teams for a few reasons, but just to play Devil's Advocate, have you considered that boys' sports teams tend to get more support than girls' teams and potentially have more substantial programs and developed coaching? I'm not sure what laws, if any, govern resource allocation with respect to high school teams, but even if we're not talking about money, it tends to be boys' sports teams that school spirit rallies behind and parental boosters choose to devote time to."

t3_2bnfju,cj716f4,"If that proves true, it's another reason why girls competing in boys' leagues is a good idea. All anecdotal and, again, DA, but my own source is having played competitively on women's sports teams and spent my younger years on some boys teams before reaching an age where the girls'/women's teams finally became competitive.

t3_2bkc6k,cj670yk,"So, should birth control be considered a human right? I would say probably not, but that doesn't mean insurance regulations shouldn't deal with it as a contractual right. Insurance regulation requires insurers to pay for all sorts of stuff as part of the insurance."
t3_2bk0qs,cj63kvq,"Then, you might take some cops with you, and have a good chance of dying pretty quickly with relatively less suffering. If, as a criminal, you knew that not only could you get the death penalty, but there was a good chance it would involve what you call an hour or two of suffering, wouldn't you rather just try to shoot your way out of an arrest? Then, you might take some cops with you, and have a good chance of dying pretty quickly with relatively less suffering."
t3_2bk0qs,cj66iuo,"I think your answer comes down to a simple premise: we as a society have decided that, as a rule, causing others to suffer is a Very Bad Thing(tm) and is therefore not acceptable. That's not to say we always live by that rule of course, you can point out any number of exceptions, but that doesn't change the principle. You may be thinking that's not true, that's not a principle we live by... but let me point out that if you agree crimes are wrong, which you implicitly are saying when you say you support capital punishment, then you are agreeing with the premise because crimes for which capital punishment comes into play by their nature are based on causing the suffering of others."

t3_2bk0qs,cj66iuo,"Why is one form of suffering acceptable while another is not? You can point to one and say it's ""justified"" because it's suffering in payment for an act that caused suffering, but that makes the whole thing entirely arbitrary... some actions that cause suffering are okay while others are not... who gets to decide? One other reason I'll toss in is simply that it does no good whatsoever."
t3_2bk0qs,cj66iuo,"However, if you do just a little bit of research you quickly will reach the conclusion that to those affected by the original crime, they get no real satisfaction in seeing the offender suffer. And it makes sense that it would be that way: if your daughter is raped and murdered, and you see the bastard that did it raped and murdered, you may well feel a little twinge of happiness at first, but then (a) you quickly remember that your daughter is STILL dead and STILL suffered the rape, and (b) that now you actually feel a little bit disgusted with yourself because you felt joy about the suffering of someone else, even someone that ""deserved it"". MOST people aren't wired that way thankfully..."
t3_2bk0qs,cj63aet,"Two instances of suffering can't actually cancel or balance each other out.

Because even unapologetic killers, rapists, whatever are still people."
t3_2bk0qs,cj64zeg,"Well the issue of the victim's family is a little different, and I do have to admit its less clear cut. I have a hard time accepting that idea as real, meaning I have no reason to believe that solution would actually help the family at all, but I can't unilaterally declare that it would not. What I can confidently say is that hurting a perpetrator can't actually undo or make up for the past suffering they caused their victim."

It has similar effects to abuse, is associated with PTSD, can predict future bouts of violence, including domestic violence, etc."
t3_2bhy5s,cj5hsxc,"If I want to see a high level of play, I'm not going to see it at anything less than the college level. Maybe in an ideal world where sports are completely separated from Education, but that's just not the reality. Sport scholarships are help many students afford college."
t3_2bhy5s,cj5in9t,"I would argue it's pretty self evident that the majority of student athletes are receiving an education. There's obviously going to be a few truly spectacular athletes who get their grades flubbed a bit in big name teams at major schools, but the rest of that one guys teammates are probably not getting such special treatment. They do, to remain competitive and popular."

If Universities just gave tickets away, then individuals would be scalping the tickets and that revenue would go into private pockets."
t3_2bhy5s,cj5m2r2,"If you completely remove sports from education, you eliminate a lot of scholarship opportunities, as well as the opportunity for many students to participate in athletics in any meaningful way. There's a problem with providing outstanding students compensation commensurate with the value that they bring to a University, in that it undermines a lot of other areas that are inherently non-profitable, but SHOULD be undertaken by Universities. If a hotshot graduate chemistry student discovers some amazing new compound while working for the University, they are more likely than not going to receive any kind of compensation other than recognition for it."

t3_2aymhj,cj0yroe,"The Russian Silver Fox domestication experiment, for example, took about forty years and URL of extremely intensive selection (only letting the top 5% of males and 20% of females breed) to bring a single trait- tameness- to a ~75% prevalence in the population. Not perfect by any means, but a fairly major difference from wild-type. Humans, though, have a generation time an order of magnitude longer- usually somewhere around 20-30 years, depending on culture."
t3_2aymhj,cj0yroe,"To achieve results similar to what was seen with the foxes, we're looking at something like 700 or a thousand years. Initiating a selective breeding program for humans, then, would require not only that a dedicated and invasive bureaucratic apparatus with rigorous record-keeping and incredibly broad authority be created, but that it exist in a largely unchanged state for significantly longer than the lifespan of most continuous governments. --- Also, on an unrelated note, gene therapy isn't limited to fetuses- URL a case where it was used to cure hereditary colour blindness in adult monkeys."

t3_2aymhj,cj161tw,"You are, in effect, sacrificing entire genomes to get rid of deleterious qualities controlled by a comparatively small number of individual genes. Gene therapy would allow the specifically deleterious alleles of these genes to be targeted and altered while allowing the rest of the genome to survive and contribute to the overall reproductive diversity of the population (and, incidentally, to the spread of the advantageous alleles it's been modified to possess). Governments (and other higher organizations) are made up of individuals, though."

It may have succeeded in slowing population growth, but it wouldn't've been very successful at all as a form of enforced eugenics. I'd be very surprised if it isn't repealed within a generation or two."

Unconditional gets much of the time on reddit but is extraordinarily poorly supported in advanced economies; its incredibly expensive (the distortionary effects from increasing taxation to pay for it would counteract its economic benefits many times over), would have a huge labor discouragement issue and would cause significant inflationary problems. Unconditional basic income in an advanced economy would eviscerate economic growth without correcting many of the problems those who support it claim."
t3_2ayhxt,cj01q09,"CBI would correct the lack of mobility between low-income and middle-income families. Currently mobility remains strong and mostly flat for the last several decades between middle-income and high-income families but poverty, and the systems we have in place to manage it, result in a poverty trap problem where its extraordinarily difficult for those in poverty to work themselves out of it. Likewise generational mobility suffers the same problem, those born in to poverty are far more likely to remain in poverty throughout their lives then they should be."
t3_2ayhxt,cj01q09,"While UBI is very expensive (at least $1.5t over baseline) CBI costs less then the programs it replaces as it has almost no administration overhead (its managed via the tax system).

t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"Before I go further I'd like to clarify that while very obvious in its slant, this post is in no way trying to say that polyamory is the only or the best arrangement for humans and that much of the stuff I point out is the general state of the emotional psychology of the human species. I myself tend towards a desire for monogamy, but I think there is ample rationality to support the idea that polyamory may be a better overall social construct by which to conduct our lives. Friendships are relationships too, and I think far too many people make the mistake of both ignoring friends as potential sexual partners, and also the converse mistake of assuming their sexual partners are automatic loyal friends."
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,Consider maybe humans would be better off if we completely removed the social stigma of who people have sex with when and why and the limitations and restrictions of only being able to have sex with a single person at a time. There would probably be far more opportunities for all humans to find not only friends but sex partners as well. There would probably be far more opportunities for you to have sex with one of the select few highly attractive people that you say are the only ones you're attracted to enough to consider having sex with.
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"I think a vast majority of potential sexual relationships don't occur simply out of social stigma for not wanting to be seen or known to be having sex with another person for various social stigma reasons - that person is a geek, or fat, or otherwise socially unattractive, yet in my experience, often times the growth of genuine close intimate friendship starts to trump those originally perceived problems. I think shallow is a term leveled by people who are probably shallow themselves because of exactly this reason - that they know there are many people with whom they'd gladly and willingly have casual (but really nothing is ever casual) sexual relations and with whom they'd like to develop a deeper/further/lasting/intimate friendship/bond but they avoid doing so because of perceived social stigma and not because of their actual internal desires and also because doing so would likely preclude the possibility of being able to ""do it"" with someone better if someone better came along. As the saying goes, the grass is always greener."
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"While it sometimes happens, friends far less often badger their friends to stop drinking than do monogamously romantic partners. The simple reason for this is that friends usually have other friends they can go hang out with and don't have to put up with Bob's drinking but Bob is still fundamentally fun to hang out with and drink with from time to time. When a person is stuck with a sexual partner, there tends to develop a pretty intense desire for that sexual partner to be adequately fulfilling, and the ways in which that partner is not adequately fulfilling are magnified far more times over than would normally be the case if that relationship were more like a good/intimate/deep regular friendship."

Maybe the warped view of relationships that the media presents as so irrationally necessary despite there not being great reasons to enter them has to do at least partially with the fact that the media by and large only really presents monogamy as the main viable option and with the importance of intimacy to the human animal, most human animals find themselves in a somewhat desperate situation to both fulfill their need for companionship and sexual release, but also stay within the bounds and confines of the standard social norms.

It can sometimes leave a bad taste, but often players writhe around on the floor in genuine pain (high impact collisions hurt like hell, but only for a few minutes), or just to have a quick rest, because soccer is one of the most physically demanding mainstream sports there is."

The next point about how quickly things change in soccer is an entirely subjective point, and for many people is part of the appeal of soccer."
t3_29koa9,cim0cmu,"This is not the case in soccer. For example, a team which is multiple divisions below another team (say Plymouth Argyle Vs. Man Utd) could meet in the cup, and despite Man Utd controlling the game for 90 minutes, a Plymouth Argyle 91st minute counter attack could turn the game from extra time and a probable Utd win, into a memorable victory for the minnows, something which is possible, but much less likely in other sports (including american football) due to how hard it is to prevent any team from scoring points.

Iran, Gareth Bale at Tottenham - all pulling moments of magic out of thin air, providing excitement and often leaving you in awe of their individual brilliance, rather than being shoehorned into a rigid system. However, tactics are often used in football to great effect - look at Atletico Madrid in La Liga this year, in terms of individual players they are far inferior to Barcelona and Real Madrid, but the rigid and structured manner in which they played, allowed them to win the league, which was extremely unexpected at the beginning of the season. There is a huge variety in soccer, you just need to be more versed in the game than you are to see it."
t3_29koa9,cim0cmu,"In soccer the action never stops (as cheesy as that sounds), and anyone that watches soccer would realise that there is no need for many goals to make a match interesting, it is the back and forth action and the near misses that are much more exciting than a 6-0 rout. Watch the video i posted above for evidence, or the recent 2-1 win by Germany over Algeria, a game which was 0-0 for more than 90 minutes, but was an enthralling game. Overall, at the end of the day whether you prefer soccer or American football comes down to how you like your sports."

Soccer players flop all the time too, but a lot of their time on the ground is legitimate, since they play with their feet it's easy for an opponent to get tangled up and bring a person to the ground even if there isn't a lot of force behind it."

Similarly Ghana is a team well known for their power on the counter attack to catch the defense off guard and the United States was able to play around this by playing more defensive than usual so Ghana was in possession of the ball more than normal but they never really got a chance to turn around attack with greater numbers. There's plenty of strategy involved in the line up, against Portugal Jurgen Klinsman used 5 midfielders to pack it in there and give the United States a stronger presence everywhere on the field."

I've mostly already addressed the idea about the low score not reflecting how much action is in the game, but the one last thing I want to say is that the lower scoring games also make each goal a really big deal, which you can see by how much players celebrate when they do get one, as well as how crazy it gets when for the fans.

The LCBO is something I'm opposed to ideologically, but frankly I'm not all that passionate about abolishing it due to practical concerns. The LCBO is a huge buyer of liquor and wine, and its size allows for the kind of purchasing power we otherwise wouldn't have in small town liquor stores."

Someone who feels they were raped should be supported, and should be given the space to talk about why they feel this way."

The folk movement was also really upset when Dylan went electric, but that hardly damaged folk music forever more. That aside, easily-digestiable and accessible music will always be popular, no matter what genre."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"I appreciate your clarification about the type of damage. Mumford shares sonic qualities with folk, but not the sensibilities. I don't believe that sharing a sound with a genre necessitates sharing the same messages, and as many artists currently use similar musical ""tricks"" in honest, heartfelt songwriting I don't think these tricks are inherently negative or manipulative, or even poor from a musical standpoint."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"There are people who don't want to be challenged or enlightened by their music, they just want ear candy and Mumford fits the bill. The feel-good but simplistic artists often win out over superior artists in more genres and mediums than just folk music. Take Macklemore's win over Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys and on the charts: Kendrick is more technically proficient, more innovative, and offers a more complex emotional and political message."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"A ""big message"" doesn't necessarily lead to superior art, and the idea that the biggest or most award-winning of a genre are also the best examples of that genre is demonstrably false. As a young person who was too often swayed by a big crescendo and emotional delivery that belied the actual message, I'd argue my tastes were not influenced by what was most popular or easily accessible, but by my lack of life experience. I simply did not have the emotional maturity to determine how honest or truthful a song was, and missed the true meaning or messages by many artists that did have something to say."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"People who do not have the capacity to see music as trite or manipulative at any age aren't necessarily going to derive more meaning or value from a song that more meaning or value. I understand why you want more, but Mumford has not demonstrated that they're interested or capable of writing the messages you want to hear. They are not obligated by merely borrowing elements of a sound, and despite their success they're not (as far as I know) widely labeled as the best modern folk has to offer."

By limiting the discussion of the view to Catholics, we can avoid the debate over what the bible says."
t3_25jy2j,chhzp43,"If people determine their lives and their moral codes based upon what someone else tells them their moral code should be, then it is much easier for them to defend any of their views (abortion or otherwise).

t3_24faei,ch6kqtm,"What is constitutionally required to apply the 'best interests' standard is gleaned from that state's own statutes and case law. It has been a while since family law, but I'm pretty sure the general rule is fit parents get the final say unless there is some overarching 'best interest of the child' concern. For example, if the child had effectively been raised by the grandparent for X years and it would be a detriment to the child to remove the grandparent from the situation entirely."
t3_24faei,ch6kqtm,"For example, if the child had effectively been raised by the grandparent for X years and it would be a detriment to the child to remove the grandparent from the situation entirely.

What is constitutionally required to apply the 'best interests' standard is gleaned from that state's own statutes and case law."
t3_24faei,ch6ku0s,"Also, I guess I'd ask why grandparents categorically shouldn't have any rights. It might just boil down to a standing issue, where there's no per se right to visitation but grandparents are allowed to sue and have their case heard on the merits in court, since most of these cases are decided on a case-by-case basis. Many grandparent visitation statutes provide clear contours for justiciability (which just means you get to talk about the substance of your claim rather than being booted out of court for not being a proper party who has suffered some redressable injury.)"
t3_24faei,ch6lkf5,"In my experience, especially with people who are lower-income, a lot of the family steps up to help raise a kid and becomes actively involved in the child's life, usually as de facto surrogates (e.g., babysitting a child while the parent works, taking them to school, helping with homework, etc.) Again, the presumption is heavily in favor of a fit parent's decision, but if the child has bonded with the grandparent because of their regular - maybe even constant - presence and affection, then courts tend to be concerned about how that fit parent's decision affects the 'best interests' of the child. The burden is still on the grandparents."

t3_24dj00,ch62yhy,"For why we can't just use 'normal people', you hit the reason on the head yourself. Transpeople are fully aware they're a tiny minority, but there's a social context there of 'abnormal' being used to refer to mental illness or other unwanted conditions. Just like it's considered rude to call black people abnormal, even if they are also a minority of people in a country: 'normal' has taken on a more psychological than mathematical definition."
t3_24dj00,ch62yhy,"But if we're talking about queer theory and we agree that separating it into 'normal people' and 'abnormal people' doesn't work because it's needlessly alienating, it is useful to have a term that means not-trans. It makes sense not to explicitly label yourself as cis, but if you're talking about trans or queer issues then you might need to say something about cis people as a group. Just like with your 'special needs' example, some people use 'neurotypical' to mean someone who is not special needs."
t3_24dj00,ch62yhy,"Just like with your 'special needs' example, some people use 'neurotypical' to mean someone who is not special needs.

So, very simply, a vote for a third party is usually worthless in the US because of our electoral system; however, if by chance a third party has a good year, you will see at least one party co-opt the ideas of it so that they can win over the people who did not vote for them."

t3_21g6jy,cgcq2pw,"Hugo Chavez was a social democrat, much like many European leaders, and was elected in 18 elections (no term limits, and he lost one election late in his career, so he wasn't just rigging the vote every time as the U.S. media sometimes pretends). The problem, though, isn't with communism or Marxist ideology necessarily, but with the idea of violent revolution and the men who usually end up leading such a revolution. Lenin very much believed in communism, as did Trotsky, but Stalin was never a strong ideologue or adherent to the cause."

t3_21g6jy,cgcq2pw,"Instigating and supporting coups of elected governments from Iran to half of South and Central America, we are not exactly remembered kindly through much of the world, and for good reason. TL;DR: partly, it's bad history and the U.S. rarely admits that nations we don't agree with can also be democracies, and partly it's not the particular ideology of communism that produces authoritarian regimes, but rather the nature of violent revolution attracting strongmen types who become leaders and seize power. "
t3_21g6jy,cgcwchp,"So maybe Castro hasn't done so badly after all, all things considered. I would definitely agree that Hugo Chavez was a ""Bolivarian revolutionary"" and that his system of government had strong socialist leanings, but keep in mind that his government's hostility toward the United States had less to do with ideology than the knowledge of U.S. interventionism in Latin America. Because of his resistance to U.S. interests in the region, the U.S. government (and its counterpart in the loyal beltway media) preferred to represent him as a strongman/authoritarian/dictator when in reality the elections in Venezuela were essentially free and fair, and Chavez maintained popular support throughout his reign, especially among the working classes in that nation."
t3_21g6jy,cgcwchp,"Additionally, he was dealing with crippling economic sanctions and a deeply skeptical ally in the Soviet Union, which ultimately removed his access to defensive nuclear weapons capabilities to avoid escalation between the USSR and the US. With that kind of serious security threat (an aggressive superpower ninety miles from your coast), and the crippling economic sanctions imposed on an island nation just out of a destabilizing revolution, combined to make successful improvements in the lives of Cubans all but impossible for decades following the revolution. Not that I think Castro was a phenomenal leader, but much of the failures we attribute to his communist regime were really caused by factors outside of his control."

Additionally, had the US (right up to the present day) not taken such a harsh anti-Castro position on Cuba, to the point of being irrational (the Cold War ended twenty five years ago, yet we still maintain an embargo), Cuba would likely be a much more free and open society today."
t3_21g6jy,cgcwchp,"Following his death in 1953, the process of ""destalinization"" and serious efforts at reform under Khrushchev, and then Brezhnev, and ultimately Gorbachev, increasingly brought the USSR into a more free and open society than had existed in the decades after the Russian revolution. Of course, the USSR backed multiple dictators in eastern Europe, but that crime was committed on a similar scale by the United States, another relatively free and open society, propping up dictators all across South and Central America, and also in South Vietnam and South Korea. The bottom line, I guess, is that the US and USSR used the Cold War as an excuse to promote friendly dictators all around the world."

t3_217z08,cgamd0q,"So your heuristic (don't hire women of childbearing age) seems to be okay on the surface. Let's say your current employees fall on a one-dimensional talent distribution as a sample of the larger available employment pool, and further let's assume the talent of the workers is normalized.

If you consider that people's talent and their desired wage are somewhat independent, and that people will trade non-financial factors for wages (time off to take care of family, for instance, might be worth $10,000/annum to someone), then you should be able to see that you ought to be able to find the same productivity as your upper-half performers for less than you currently do on the existing labor market."

Well, again, if you make the assumption that you lose one year per five from women of childbearing age (birth, maternity leave, doctor's visits, sick children, etc), then for a given talent distribution you should be able to trade them 20% of their salary for non-salary benefits (flexible scheduling, work at home opportunities) and still come out even with where you are now. Given that you're not currently hiring from this talent pool, I would suggest that your company is hurt by not having women."

Maybe we'll detach it entirely from anatomical femaleness or malenessand impose it on no one, but there will probably still be people who want to self-identify as 'femme' or 'butch' long afterwards, and we will probably find that there are certain constellations of personality traits and interests and so on which tend to go hand in hand and form an intelligible gestalt of ""masculinity"" or ""femininity"". tl;dr gender will one day be useful as a matter of semiotics and performativity, after it has ceased to be a system of oppression."

I really don't mean to be derisive or flip when I say this: but it's hard to conceptualize what it's like to be in the type of committed relationship that a marriage represents until you've done it. I'll say (and I think that many married people would agree with me) that I never wanted to get married until I decided that I wanted to marry my wife.

Not going to claim I've read everything here, but ctrl+f doesn't seem to find this point being addressed, so hopefully it hasn't... Your objections on the psychological-not-physical front seem to be non-trivially anchored on gender performance and the idea that transition inherently reifies the gender binary - that if we only broadened our minds about our ideas of ""man"" and ""woman"", people would no longer feel compelled to transition."

For example, I know a number of trans men who lived large portions of their lives as butch women - whose lives revolved around women and butchness and the lesbian community - who still transitioned, even while they continue to love and support equally butch women who remain firmly woman-identified. Secondly, there are many, many trans people who are lgbq [hi!"

A state says you have a right to property, but the guarantee of that right is contingent upon your acceptance of that state's authority. Thus if you fail to pay taxes, you lose your rights."
t3_20p6rz,cg5mbgy,"But the only thing that makes that true is the contract; if a third party comes along and doesn't adhere to that agreement, he could kill you and not be abrogating your rights in his own mind and thus not doing so objectively. We could call that murder to describe what's happening, but that doesn't necessitate that an objective right has been violated. Consider that we don't call all forms of killing murder."
t3_20p6rz,cg5mbgy,"The simple answer to your question is no, you don't objectively have ownership over your life or body. This is true, but it has always been true.

Good point, you didn't explicitly use that word, but there's something in your language that makes me feel like you are blaming the women for encouraging rape... I think it might go back to that dismissive ""excepting"" that I mentioned earlier: Women have always chosen this, (except when they didn't...) it makes it sound like the situation they're in now is the result of their choice, and neglects the fact that not-choosing has happened throughout ages of human development, up to and including recent times."

t3_1z0efm,cfpdtdk,"But first, a sidenote :). The US Civil War (1861-1865) marked the end of slavery but not racist laws or practices - those were still supported by a pre-Civil-War US Supreme Court case from 1856, Dred Scott v. Stanford. Once Lincoln died right after the war, America's top civil rights leader was John Bingham, who wrote the 14th Amendment to protect the newly freed southern blacks from civil rights abuses at the hands of the ""proto-KKK""."
t3_1z0efm,cfpdtdk,"Because the 2nd Amendment of 1792 was in large part a ""political right"" (militia duty) that was similar to the right to vote and serve on juries. And in 1868 when the 14th passed, blacks didn't yet have political rights - they had civil rights (recognized by the 14th) but not political rights. Therefore the political right to militia duty was at least heavily supplemented by a personal civil right to defend against private criminals."

My best guess, and this is from being a hardcore gun guy (but a major handgunner, not a rifleman) for 15 years now, is there's 50,000 people in the US that can hit a man-sized target at 800 yards with a gun, scope and ammo that they own right now.

More unholy screaming that still fucking haunts me -- but here's the thing, he was restrained, but they still didn't force medication. They just offered it as a way out -- if he could get the medication, he could probably be stable enough to not be in restraints again, to go socialize with the other patients and such."

He clearly had a long, hard road ahead of him, but this was already just night and day, after one day on the medication.

Okay, here's my take, broken into a few sections: Legality I don't think this is what you're talking about, but I thought I'd mention it briefly anyway. When we're talking about legality, we might talk about what ""rights"" a person or entity has or doesn't have."
t3_1yhd8w,cfkunw0,"If I create something and you pirate it, I'm not actually losing anything, so where's the harm. This actually isn't the main angle I'd use to approach the morality of piracy, but there is a point I think is important. You claim that you ""wouldn't"" have bought it anyway and have described the product as having some value relative to other priorities in your life (food, clothing, etc) and that there's a disconnect between this value and what the listed price of the software is."
t3_1yhd8w,cfkunw0,"This justifies your belief that you wouldn't have bought it anyway, as it didn't have enough value. This is all fine, but I don't think you can honestly claim that your value assessment of the product is not affected by the possibility of pirating it for free. The mere fact that torrenting it is even an option that your considering reduces the value of the product, and thus unfairly raises the bar for what you're willing to pay for."
t3_1yhd8w,cfkunw0,"So indirectly, I'd argue that the way piracy affects your value judgments and purchasing decisions does result in actual list sales for content right near the threshold of what you'd be willing to buy. You can maybe wiggle out of this if the buyer is extremely honest and self-aware, but in general, I'm really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they'd make if piracy wasn't on the table. But I'll concede that if you have a really large bold IF qualifying your claim, maybe there's no financial impact."

So, like a painting does utilize narrative, but has specific qualities which seperate it from other mediums, URL It utilizes the limit of the picture plane to make it's composition and is trying to convey how endless and majestic the field is by allowing it to take up so much space. Brush strokes are used to give a unique experience of whirliness, that is easy to get lost in, and is contrasted by the straightness of adjacent brushstrokes, helping to make the field stand out and feel unique to the rest of the painting."

But more on that later, first: TL;DR: The horrific things you see today are not actually the ""teachings of Islam"", but are a political tool that has been used on and off for centuries to attempt to gain control of people and gain political/societal dominance and fit it into a religious context for the sake of gaining a following. These people are put into the forefront of Western media for the sake of building a demonized image of the people that the Western world is currently having political tensions and/or war with."

It's got a lot to do with old grudges, past wars, and Israel, but I am not getting into that political minefield even later on in the post, for the sake of my own sanity. The idea of Islam being a violent culture originates from this media representation as well as a couple other key factors such as: The Qur'an: Have you seen the Muslim population's reaction to the US burnings of the Qur'an?"
t3_1xhrpt,cfbkr47,"It is the infinite, untainted and most holy work of God. It was not made by the hands of man but instead those hands were merely used to make it visible to us. The Qur'an is far holier than the Bible ever has been, and the reaction it produces it proportional to its importance."

t3_1xhrpt,cfbkr47,"The key difference, however, is that Christianity was born through nonviolence, whereas Islam was born through war. Both went to war of course, but the Muslims admit it. However, all of this being said, when Muhammad was alive Islam was barely even a thing."

You see, this is not a tenet of the faith of Islam."

In short, if you are ok with genetic testing and will abort if there is an issue and/or you have a condition where the penetration of the disease process is potentially low (up for debate what this # is by the way), then it's a calculated risk that you can skew in your favor and is not necessarily unreasonable."

t3_1uhj8f,cei5r73,"Here is an illustration why: even though it seems too surprising, too incomprehensible that other hunks of meat in other human heads could give rise to conscious thought, that surprising-ness is just as real with regards to the hunks of meat in our own heads, and yet we have first-person direct acquaintance with our conscious experience nonetheless. Step back and don't think about your brain as ""yours"" but rather think about your brain as this physical object ""here"" and another person's brain as that physical object ""over there"".

t3_1ugfg7,cehxooj,"Right. This answer may be a tad complex and I'm unsure if I can express it well, but bear with me. In practice, whenever you make a statement about something, in reality you say two separate things."
t3_1ugfg7,cehxooj,"Hopefully, this is all self-evident. But from a sociological perspective, you also make a second statement; ""not only do I believe that there is a dog on my left, but I believe that this is worth saying "". Upon reflection, this makes perfect sense; why would you say something that you didn't think was worth saying?"
t3_1ugfg7,cehxooj,"They aren't saying that you aren't allowed to have an opinion on the matter. What they *are* taking issue with is that second function; the fact that, in some contexts, criticism can amount to not only an impartial expression of opinion but as a sociological wedge to gain a social advantage. It's not about your ""right to criticise"", which is obviously key to freedom of thought and information; it's about curtailing abuse of that right where it is used to unjustly gain a social edge."
t3_1ueg7f,ceh8q6y,"For example, the refusal to allow black people or women to work in certain jobs would be an example where a group of people don't have equal opportunities. This lack of equal opportunities means that these people have less chances to actually live the life they want so it results in a non-""equal life"" but the fact that non-""equal life"" exists is not what equality campaigners want to remove - they are campaigning to remove barriers to stopping people doing what they want to do.

Many games are decided within 2 or 3 points; 2 or 3 baskets."

The difference undoubtedly is in the probability of scoring and thus winning, but this probability is simply, once again, a determinant of the pace and rate of scoring.

In contrast, we're in a changing landscape with growing cohabitation, where you sort of have this tension between courts wanting to impose marriage-like rights and responsibilities on couples but the tedious and costly process of having to execute a plethora of legal documents to come close to the scheme that marriage presumptively creates and can later be tailored to your situation. This might not be enough to tip the scale for you, personally, but I think it shows why there are plenty of good reasons for people (including men-people) in Western society to consider tying the knot, as opposed to 'not many' good reasons."

You heard a few comments which offended your sensibilities, but you haven't heard from the vast majority of women who agonize over the decision and feel it's the right thing to do. They don't all take it lightly, and who are we to say they made the wrong decision?"

t3_1t46ur,ce487fh,"And those that do go through with it, would suffer more greatly due to the direct action of ""killing"" someone. Sorry, but this just seems like an underhanded tactic to force fewer people to get abortions regardless of the reasons for the abortions. "
t3_1t46ur,ce4dbae,"However, I also believe that a woman has a right to control her body as she sees fit. Thus I am pro-choice, but anti-abortion. I just think that the type of change that you propose would force women to make a choice based on emotions rather than on logic/need and I do not think that this is the right way to curtail abortions."

However, the rural areas are extremely important to the country as a whole, as they may not have large populations but they do provide food and much of the other goods you enjoy.

t3_1sv960,ce1x8f8,"You can psychoanalyze these people the same as criminals, and it they escalate, they won't stop. My view may sound extreme here, and this definitely is in extreme examples, but that's from my experience.

t3_1suyq6,ce1hrcm,"In at least one case, I was extremely disappointed with the original material as compared to what some people had done with it in fanfiction. I am also enjoy fanfiction, but it is not a guilty pleasure for me. It is a way to explore the characters and the story in depth in a way that no writer has the time to in a normal story."
t3_1suyq6,ce1hrcm,"I am also a fan of crossover fanfiction, where the possibilities are almost endless of characters from various works of fiction meeting under a myriad of circumstances and the events that can play out. Yes the vast majority of fanfiction you will find is not very high quality, but if you search hard enough you will find many stories that are just as good if not better than the original. There are a few works of fiction that I only started reading/watching because I enjoyed a few fanfiction stories that used characters or setting from them and I decided to go to the source."
t3_1suyq6,ce1jnf5,"Fanfiction is a well established part of literature dating back to when we first started putting stylus to clay tablets during Sumerian times and folks started riffing on creation myths. Much of modern Western literature evolved from the equivalent of fanfiction and some scholars would argue that Chinese literature is essentially nothing but. And some stories have simply become archetypes, spawning all manner of (effective) fanfiction: the Odyssey, Romeo and Juliet, Cinderella, the passion of Christ (which inspired the ending to Harry Potter, itself the most copied in fanfiction story extant), the Arthurian myths, Roland, Beowulf."

t3_1sunm5,ce1fx1q,"We simplify so many things in engineering, and only through hands on learning can you actually see what this means. For example, an engine cycle is not a perfect sequence of isobaric, isothermal, and adiabatic expansions or compressions, but if we approximate it that way we can get results that are close enough, and that's all that matters. Teaching by lecture alone enforces the idea that this is actually how an engine works, which is just wrong."
t3_1sunm5,ce1fx1q,"Like in point number 1, kids are forced to reconcile the differences between real world data and the theory.

As for your objections, I think /u/ablarga nails it."
t3_1stysh,ce1a8iy,"Calling /r/atheism a circlejerk is like calling /r/spacedicks absurd - that's the whole point. Now, when it comes to ""ideological wars"", which, by the way, is a ludicrous overstatement, I would contend that it is not only inevitable, but it's functionally equivalent to what is considered 'debate' on the internet. Again, you claim that people only engage in these 'wars' because they want to sound intellectually superior."

Not only is this the method that the US would have used in the past (for example, in Vietnam and Cambodia) but the Pakistani military continues to use them today. When Pakistan knows a village is a Taliban strong hold (and they don't need that Taliban cell for anything at the moment) they just shell the village off the map."
t3_1sslvc,ce0xojx,"So what does that leave us? There are really three options: 1: The US military continues it's drone program, which results in a small number of accidental deaths, but effectively decimates the leadership of AQAP and the Pakistani Taliban. It also allows the US to take the blame for the drone strikes, which, in the grand summation of things, is better than the Pakistani government taking the blame for them, as it allows for a better chance for peace negotiations."

t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"There were two things that (almost) all Indians had in common however - we wanted the British out, and we trusted the Mahatma . Sure, there were many people who fought valiantly against the British, but there was only one man who recognised the importance of a united struggle and actually got everyone fighting under one banner. Further, his method of non-violence ensured that the British departed on good terms, and that the ones who came to power in newly independent India weren't warlords at the heads of militia (like countless African nations and Afghanistan in the 90's."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"He also ensured that post-Independence we did not tear each other apart on communal lines, though we've been trying hard since. To take no credit away from all the other freedom fighters, but they thought small. The Rani of Jhansi just wanted the British out from Jhansi, Bose thought violence could achieve his ends (and allied with the Empire of Japan, who would have been far worse than the British), Tilak would eventually have gotten independence .. for Bombay province."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"As for his personal traits, I feel that only one is important - that he wasn't interested in power. He could easily have set himself up as a benevolent dictator, but he never did. As for his other traits (such as his alleged sexual ""deviance""), they're irrelevant."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"The man helped free 200 million people and forged a nation - what he did in the bedroom is no business of ours. That's it on the Mahatma, but I noticed in another comment that you don't much care for Ambedkar either. I feel that Ambedkar is important for two reasons - his efforts to reform the Hindu civil code over the course of a decade had a huge impact on the lives of 90% of the women in India."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"You couldn't adopt children belonging to another caste. All of these things, and other injustices contributed to the lousy position of women in Indian society. His ceaseless and tireless efforts in the 50's to get these bills passed made a big difference to the lives of women in India."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"But the second and arguable more important reason for his relevance was he was a low-caste man who had made it big in life through hard work. His caste meant he was supposed to be cleaning toilets, but instead he was shaping the policies of the nation. He proved to the millions of low and backward caste people in India that it is possible to succeed if you apply yourself to it, that their status depends on their actions, not on their birth."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy30x8,"Again, I reiterate that while Gandhi had minor flaws, they are inconsequential in the face of his accomplishments. The sub continent would eventually have seen the end of British rule, one way or another thanks to the efforts of several thousand freedom fighters, but it saw the birth of a united India because of Gandhi. To drive this point home, let me point out that many places in India still consider themselves separate from the Union."

I'm going to try and shift the tone of my 'rebuttal' to your CMV from trying to convince you that it's okay for your boyfriend to smoke weed, to why the actual problem isn't his smoking weed. It appears that your tendency in this situation is to decipher a 'right' and a 'wrong' person in the situation (i.e., you are searching for reasons why his use is objectively wrong, such as legal or personality change reasons."

I'll give it a shot, but this is going to be a bit of a devil's advocate.

Up until that point, they never counted me as a vegan, and there are plenty of people I know who don't count me as a vegan, so even though they've met a vegan who does not meet your stereotype, they don't make the association between my behavior and veganism."

I have personally learned a few ways to defuse this situation, but it is very easy to get defensive and start countering this attack.

 Always looking for new women * Never able to keep anybody You're kind of sabotaging yourself by trying to hard. I doubt the problem is your chemistry or personality, but rather your approach. Since there is no easy book on finding love or good companionship, it's kind of left to everyone to figure out."
t3_1qwdul,cdhd52x,"An actual date - like, you're going on dates 5-7 days out of the week? If it's the latter and you are going on actual dates 5-7 days out of the week, again, that's pretty predatory behavior already; I get your methodology and how you arrived there, but you're forgetting the reputation you're developing. Your behavior is going to sabotage your potential because strangers you don't know will witness your behavior and instantly write you off because of it."
t3_1qwdul,cdhd52x,"The problem is that you seemingly don't want that, so while the more sensible elements of confidence and getting them to talk about themselves will work, a lot of the other stuff - the mind games, sexual forwardness, the emotional disconnect, would sabotage your efforts. The core problem is that PUA focus on a core type of woman (They say it's for all women, but it's not, their petty little shit only works on certain types of women.) that you're probably not looking for."
t3_1qwdul,cdhf23v,"Again, even 1 a month is pretty successful. I get that you feel like your numbers are dismal, but you need to compare it to the overall pool, and I know plenty of other people who go a lot longer with zero anything. You're already way ahead of the curve ."
t3_1qwdul,cdhf23v,"To me, as the outsider, I'm not necessarily picking it up 'You don't know what you have until you lose it' I'm getting more 'I didn't realize he was trying to foster a relationship.' I know they don't sound very dissimilar, but it's more the sentiment behind it. Whereas you seem to think they only come around once they realize you've moved on, it very well could be that you didn't send signals that you were trying to develop it."
t3_1qwdul,cdhf23v,"I don't think PUA is for you, because it doesn't seem to be what your after. You could probably gleam a few useful nuggets about confidence and directing conversations, but a lot of the mind games employed to get in someone's pants is the exact opposite of what anybody trying to find a relationship is going to be looking for; what's worse, is if they're savvy they make recognize it for the game that it is. PUA involves a lot of effective methods, that's why they're successful, but rarely is the end intention to nab a potential mate for the long term; so a lot of the manipulative shit they say to do, is detrimental to fostering a healthy relationship, but very good at developing a sexual one."

I guess feasibly you could employ the mind games ad infinitum to string this poor girl along for the rest of her life, but that's fucking weird. Here comes the dear abbey derail the thread questions: How do your first dates usually play out?"
t3_1qwdul,cdh6jv3,"If you keep meeting people that you feel beneath, I would suggest improving your self-worth so that you don't feel beneath anyone. It's difficult, but I think it would be a more successful tactic for you in the long-run. TL;DR I think working on knowing yourself and avoiding dating for a bit is a better course of action than PUA."
t3_1qwdul,cdh9pw7,"All of the people he met using PUA were some version of this same story. PUA is a good way to meet people, sure, but it seems like, at least from his experience, that the people that respond best to PUA techniques are not the type of people who care about much beyond themselves. "
t3_1qwdul,cdhewq0,"Throughout the thread I don't get a good sense of who you are, or what kind of woman you're interested in. As you mention a few places you certainly ""look good on paper"" but I don't really have any sense of who you are as a person. As for what you want in a woman, I don't think I've seen that anywhere yet either."
t3_1qwdul,cdhy9nr,"I'm getting the sense that you haven't yet truly focused on yourself, and I think that's what you need to try before PUA. Introspection is certainly part of it, but it's not the whole thing. For example, I can be introspective all day about stresses at work, or I can be introspective all day about stresses at work and how I'm going to take them down because I know I can."
t3_1qwdul,cdhy9nr,"You want someone to be with you for who you are, so you have to show them that who you are is someone who knows their own awesomeness. I know you're not asking for advice, but here's what I would suggest: take a month or two and forget about women and dating entirely. It's off the table."
t3_1qwdul,cdhy9nr,"You're not going to do it. If you meet a woman, great, but forget everything about dating her and meet her as an equal and a friend. Do things for yourself that you want to do, when you want to do them."
t3_1qwdul,cdigp3t,"Because even though I'm a man, if I were a woman, we went out on a date, and (assuming you're as great as you claim) I got this laundry list of accomplishments out of you, my first thought would be ""what is wrong with this guy that he's made it to 29 without anybody locking him down?"" That is, of course, spectacularly unfair, but obviously you wonder this, so why shouldn't I? You might try seriously downplaying that resume of yours."
t3_1qwdul,cdigp3t,"Her: ""Wow, that sounds impressive/interesting/some other adjective that may or may not be feigning interest to spur the conversation."" You: ""I mean, I'm busy a lot, but it's a living, and I'm pretty fortunate and happy. What about you?"""
t3_1qwdul,cdigp3t,"...and keep the focus on her as much as possible. Not just because there is no better way to get somebody to like you than to let them talk about themselves, but because you want to keep the focus OFF your extraordinarily intimidating resume. Seriously, this will be a particular challenge for you."
t3_1qwdul,cdigp3t,"You own a million dollars in real estate? Great, but this is a time when half of recent college grads are working in jobs that don't require degrees; why would you think a barista would want to hear that? Even if she's doing well for herself, put yourself in her shoes; if your last three dates stayed home all day smoking weed and playing GTA, wouldn't YOU think women should be beating down this magic man's door?"
t3_1qwdul,cdj3osu,"Ok, that's great, right track, etc. I know that all seems obvious, but I mentioned it because it's especially important for YOU SPECIFICALLY, given your accomplishments, to not give the appearance of self-absorption. There isn't much I or anybody else can say about how you present yourself, because we don't know you; we can mention common problems, you can respond that you understand and steer clear of them, and we get nowhere because nobody can verify it."
t3_1qwdul,cdj3osu,"I will say two things, though: 1) Narcissists are, in this day and age, EXTREMELY common, and have huge blind spots to their own narcissism. Again, nothing against you, but you could very well think you're the picture of greatness while being completely insufferable. We should all be on notice of this; my short advice is that URL has a lot of really ass-clenching things to say about narcissism in America, so you (and everybody) should read a whole bunch of his stuff and soul-search."
t3_1qwdul,cdj3osu,"If there is something glaringly unlikable about your personality, PUA will not get you out of addressing it. PUA might get you interest, it might get you a second date, it might even get you laid sometimes, but at some point a woman is going to wake up and get hit full-force with whatever is putting everybody else off to begin with, and if God help you you actually like her, at that point there will be a reckoning way more painful for you than the constant rejection you face now. I, like PUAs, want you to succeed, however you define that, with women."
t3_1qwdul,cdj3osu,"As a white man, I can't offer you a specific strategy for handling racist girls. PUA won't either, though, unless your strategy ends up being ""fuck this, I'm going to dehumanize the shit out them as much as they dehumanize me,"" which would be understandable, but holy shit is that a lonely way to live. "
t3_1qwdul,cdj5vts,"I don't doubt that it happens, just that, uh I have to admit I'm kind of getting mixed signals here. If women really DO fall for you when they get to know you, I can tell you with absolute confidence that you are already better off than basically every man who can spit mad game but has very little going for him beyond it. What are your expectations from dating?"
t3_1qwdul,cdj5vts,"What are your expectations from dating? If you want a relationship, how will PUA contribute? If you want a string of sexual encounters, why are your numerous positive qualities relevant?"

t3_1qw6q4,cdh4djd,"The difference plays out like this: a heteronormative couple act that way in public, then they get home, and how they engage with each other in terms of their gender roles is entirely different.

Is it something that a minority does, that is documented as being continuous, but is something that isn't accepted by the majority?"" Frankly, the word ""typical"" is not very precise."
t3_1qw6q4,cdh5dka,"You have the much smaller circle titled ""heteronormative"" within the big circle. What is considered to be ""heteronormative"" can be called typical, but there are typical things that aren't necessarily heteronormative. Lastly, to your last point- what is ""typical"" isn't necessarily observable phenomena."
t3_1qw6q4,cdh5dka,"Can we always see what couples do in their bedrooms? We can ask them, send out surveys, etc, but people lie. They lie to meet societal expectations."

t3_1qvm1n,cdgyu8j,"Okay, so you're in 10th grade, and that makes this answer a little more optimistic than I thought going in. I don't normally dabble in relationship oriented CMVs but this one struck a chord. Thing is, 10th grade is what, 15?"

t3_1qo0aj,cderzi3,"Gay people exist, we don't need to treat them special and put them on a pedestal and protect them. URL I used gay as an example there because I had the links handy, but you can substitute in any minority. Game of Thrones is a great series that is set in a very sexist world, but still manages to have a strong cast of developed and interesting female characters."

Game of Thrones is a great series that is set in a very sexist world, but still manages to have a strong cast of developed and interesting female characters. The plot isn't driven by men doing manly things, it's driven forward by everyone, regardless of gender despite being set in a sexist time."
t3_1qo0aj,cderzi3,Men and women can enjoy it because there are characters they can all identify with in some way and root for. I guess I fundamentally disagree that being sympathetic to minorities is the same as sanitizing things; GoT is anything but sanitized. You don't see the problem because you're not faced with the issue of having to choose to play a game that doesn't allow you to play an avatar that represents you or some aspect of you in a dignified way.
t3_1qo0aj,cderzi3,Women can be sexy. The new Lara Croft is sexy but dignified. Samus Aran ain't too bad looking herself.
t3_1qo0aj,cdetjn8,And I'm not arguing that all games need to have a woman protagonist or anything - just that the industry should trend toward having a more equal representation. A MacGuffin is a fairly well known trope - it's a plot device that moves the story forward but it's not really important to the plot itself. Have you ever seen Pulp Fiction?
t3_1qo0aj,cdetjn8,"Samuel L. Jackson's brief case is a good example. A part of the story revolves around making sure that brief case gets delivered where it needs to go, but what's in the brief case is never stated, and it's not really important. And for most of history, women have been subservient to men and have lacked agency."
t3_1qo0aj,cdetjn8,"Only now women are allowed to vote and have jobs and take control of their lives, and mediums like the internet make finding like minded people easier. Women are often physically weaker then men, but so what? Men aren't exactly sticking to the laws of physics in most video games."
t3_1qo0aj,cdetjn8,"Men aren't exactly sticking to the laws of physics in most video games. I'm sure there are cases where it may make sense to point out the disparity in physical strength between a man and a woman in a video game, but largely that point is irrelevant. Especially once you start including magic or technology into the mix, which are the great equalizer."
t3_1qo0aj,cdeu4tr,"They have no power to control their fate a disproportional amount of the time. If sometimes we played men saving women, but other times we played women saving men, and all other permutations of men and women saving people and things, then there would be no issue. But we keep coming back to the same thing - men saving women."
t3_1qo0aj,cdeu4tr,"People naturally project themselves into the media they consume, whether consciously or subconsciously. You say above that ""I don't see the problem because I don't have an issue when I encounter a game where I don't directly identify with the character"", but this situation is not analogous for many women and other minorities who are gamers. You do have representation, if not in the specific game you're playing right now, then in the many many other games made for your demographic."
t3_1qo0aj,cdeudco,"It doesn't mean they're a woman hating misogynist, it just means they have some outdated ideas about gender. That's definitely it in part, but that's not the whole story. Many men are perfectly able to write women characters, just as women can write men."
t3_1qj48o,cddbokg,"The other side of this is the pain that such a disease could wreck upon the family to see their kin suffering in so much pain. In someways yes, they would be/are test subjects, but in some ways it's also more quixotic as well. After all the premise of a test subject is finding a cure, instead of giving up hope of ever finding a cure."
t3_1qj48o,cddqbp8,"My girlfriend was born with an illness that kills most who get it before the age of 5. Not only did she live past that age, but she is in the rare 10% group that has no real mental or physical impairments from it. She will most likely live to a normal life expectancy and die from things other than her disease."
t3_1qiyul,cddeigz,"Unfortunately, the reality is that there are reasonable time constraints. You can give a general overview of those topics, and hopefully prepare someone for those issues, but you can't reasonably expect someone to be fully prepared to tackle those complicated subjects. Attending a higher learning center or University is about seeking out education to better yourself."
t3_1qiccr,cdd4rx7,"You wouldn't tell a botanist that they should only refer to themselves as a ""scientist"", or a baseball player that they should only call themselves a ""sports player."" Feminism is a long list of concepts and causes, and criticising the word ""feminism"" is done typically by people who don't just want to rename the movement, which would accomplish nothing of consequence, but by people who object to all of the concepts and causes the feminism stands for. There's no rule of feminism that a feminist can only care about women."
t3_1qiccr,cdd57zm,It's about learning to see people as people and not as just a gender. Obviously this is just one of the facets of the issue but my point is that women and men both are responsible for propagating those biases and holding up the system. 
t3_1qi1dr,cdd6x3m,"There is a conflation here between life expectancy and life span . Low life expectancy in years past was primarily attributable to childhood mortality and death during childbirth. People in the the 1930s and forward tended to live approximately as long as we do if they made it to adulthood, collecting SS along the way."
t3_1qi1dr,cdd6x3m,"People in the the 1930s and forward tended to live approximately as long as we do if they made it to adulthood, collecting SS along the way.

t3_1qhv03,cdczknl,"The ""weird rules"" you are referring to are probably the characteristics of certain types of poetry. Some poets do sit down with the intention of writing a Sonnet, a Haiku, or what have you, but ""poetry"" in general has no rules. Well, it's been around for a long time."
t3_1qhv03,cdczknl,"At the psychological level, humans are very good at intuitively identifying patterns. This can get us in trouble when we falsely identify clusters of data as a pattern, but in the case of rhyming, it produces a certain satisfaction that things fit together in a predictable way. If you've ever heard a song or music, then you've been touched by the same forces that made poetry."
t3_1qhv03,cdczknl,"It's literally everywhere. I don't know about you, but where I live (America), unless you choose to study poetry, no one forces you to study it beyond a certain age (read: beyond public school). During the years you are ""forced"" to study it, you're ""forced"" to do so for the same reason you're ""forced"" to study mathematics, or history, or geography, or science; it's just another element of what the powers-that-be think is part of the basic knowledge every human ought to have at his or her disposal."

If you're sharing hobbies and he picked a book series, well, that's not exactly a hobby, but maybe it means he considers the books part of him, and feels somewhat rejected that you don't like them. I think it's also possible (speaking as someone whose ex-wife loved knitting even though knitting is literally the most boring thing in the world) (no offense) that what he actually likes about knitting isn't knitting itself but feeling closer to you by sharing these things you love, and that when you refuse to share back, it feels like the thing he liked about knitting basically evaporates."

Why is this appealing?"
t3_1qfy2y,cdcoftz,"Imagine sitting in a nicely lit room, and then imagine sitting in the same nicely lit room with a bad hangover.

t3_1qfo09,cdcc9fw,"So, to deny Gay people that right is to say that the love and the feelings that they share for one another as ""inferior"", or at least ""different"", from that felt by straight couples. You can lambaste the Civil Rights comparison if you wish, OP, but the simple fact of the matter is that by separating relationships into two groups, Marriages and Civil Unions, then you are definitively stating that there is some difference, and that the Union of a Straight Couple should be treated differently than that of a Gay one. Finally, Marriage, is at the end of the day, a basic right provided to all people (don't confuse it with Matrimony, which is the religious aspect often associated with marriage)."
t3_1qfo09,cdcconr,"As long as those attitudes exist, they can't be equal. Your argument could be rephrased as ""I get that they want to be equal, and I'm find with them having equal rights, I just don't want to admit that they're equal"" You can say two halves or three thirds, but either way it still comes out to the same thing, and there's no valid reason to deny that. People don't want to give up the word marriage because they think it's special, and reserved just for them, and that by letting gays marry they'd be tarnishing the word."

No this is not a direct observance of the onset of the holiday, but this is an observance of celebrating why the holiday exists. This is why it's often custom to give the Monday after spring break off as a travel/recuperation day because a substantial amount of the student body is usually out of state/country for the duration of their break, therefore it's better to not utilize resources on a day where students are less likely to attend."

I'd maybe accept that the last 10 hours of a 40 hour work week are 5% less productive than the other 30 hours but less hours worked by a large subset of the population will lead to reduced productivity unless a large workforce can be hired to replace them.

t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"I haven't read the entire thread, but I've read a portion of it and am going to give this a shot. I apologize for the length, but I like to be thorough. I think this question is rife with potential ambiguity/misunderstanding, so I'd like to clarify a few points."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"1) What defines a successful human being? I may be wrong in making this assumption, but I would suggest that we can mostly agree that there is no objective way to define this, and that ultimately it becomes a question of values. Thus we'd have to measure the way a lack of empathy effects a variety of goals."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"Or is this person somewhere in the middle (i.e. more human), who may not care about others and may have learned enough to simulate empathy, but who is imperfect and sometimes, though not necessarily by mistake, reveals his true disinterest?

t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"more human), who may not care about others and may have learned enough to simulate empathy, but who is imperfect and sometimes, though not necessarily by mistake, reveals his true disinterest? I sense OP is dealing with this last example, but I will try to discuss all three. 3) I also think we need to differentiate a lack of empathy from a lack of people skills."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"Autism got brought up in the discussion, and while autistic people may have varying difficulties in reading social cues and responding appropriately, this does not mean that they exemplify a lack of empathy. In fact they may feel very deeply for other people but simply struggle to or completely fail to accurately interpret the emotions that other people are expressing. In this situation, learning how to read people/social indicators merely enables them to express what they want when they want."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"With that groundwork laid, I'll advance my position that while for some value systems, a lack of empathy may make success for the individual more likely in that it frees him/her to act without concern for others and thus with more focus to his/her own ends, it cannot be held universally true for all value systems and might potentially be more detrimental. I think it's been dealt with to some degree in the thread, but just to state it for the record, I believe OP has conceded that for his claim to hold true, the lack of empathy must be accompanied by the ability to simulate empathy. I would consider this a fundamental qualification to the original claim in that a lack of empathy on its own would not necessarily benefit the individual."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"At one point in the comments OP says the following: Per this model, the non-empathetic person would employ his/her empathetic veneer only when he/she perceived an advantage, which of course introduces the possibility of misjudgment. To use a real example but to cut it short, non-empathetic person (A) treats another person (B) like shit because (A) assumes (B) is insignificant and will never enter (A)'s life again. Only a little later does (A) learn that (B) is actually a high level executive at a company with which (A)'s business would love to work, and (B) would be the decision maker on the account."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"Only a little later does (A) learn that (B) is actually a high level executive at a company with which (A)'s business would love to work, and (B) would be the decision maker on the account. (A) instantly becomes excessively obsequious, but the damage has been done. The point being that unless this false empathy is maintained at all times, the possibility for missteps with serious consequences exists."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"Of course, at this point it would be relevant to argue probabilities of mistakes in a cost/benefit analysis. The game theories put forward by some contributors have some merit in calculating the odds of positive and negative outcomes, but they have a serious flaw (in my opinion) in that they have assigned outcomes with arbitrary values that could not be realized in the real world, and the one major example I saw only tried to account for interactions between two people which discounts the large amount of human interaction that involves more than two people and would be incredibly complex to calculate. And even then, for any one individual, no guarantee exists that he/she would be successful, even if the odds were in his/her favor."
t3_1pdul1,cd2og2j,"Furthermore, if a person measures his/her success on a combination of values rather than just one (which seems more realistic), if one of those values is authenticity or integrity along with some form of altruism, then I think a lack of empathy would be more of a hindrance than an aid. I could probably elaborate on that last point, but this has become massively long, and I don't really expect anyone will be reading it as I am coming a little late to the discussion, so I will end it here.

t3_1ow6zk,ccw91og,"The reason why you think that older music - music before your time - is better is that it's easier for you to find great older music, because the bands from 50 years ago that are still remembered today are the ones that have stood the test of time. Searching for good music in the present is much more tricky - not because there's less of it (because arguably there's actually far, far more), but because you don't get the convenient filter of 'music that has had lasting impact' and thus you have to wade through all the fads of the moment that the general public lap up in order to find the good stuff. My advice?"

Schools are good for teaching facts, but the problem with teaching ''how to think'' is that the teacher can end up teaching a set of premises and opinions as if they are fact ... there are many subtle ways this can happen, such as only challenging certain premises and letting others slip by unchallenged.

t3_1n3wo2,ccfmxhg,"Option 2, making vaccination mandatory by deporting those who refuse to be vaccinated, seems grossly unjust to me. While it is unfair that people receive protection from others who get vaccinated even though they don't contribute to protecting others by getting vaccinated themselves, it seems far more unfair to force those who don't wish to protect others by getting vaccinated to leave their homes to another country. So, while permitting the free riders protection is unfair, not permitting them protection by deporting them is far more unfair."
t3_1n3wo2,ccfmxhg,"Option 3, making vaccination mandatory by forcing those who refuse to be vaccinated to be vaccinated, again seems grossly unjust to me. At first you may not share my intuition, but consider what it means to go about forcing a person to be vaccinated. It may mean anything from forcibly holding the person down and giving them the vaccination as they struggle and try to stop you to threatening to extort money from the person or imprison the person and actually employing force to extort money from the person or imprison the person if they still refuse to be vaccinated despite your threat."

These are more likely root causes of conditions that lead people to need caffeine to function, but can't be addressed in the short term: for example, they may have a boring, time consuming, or erratically scheduled job and are trying to get enough experience to get a better one... but still need to avoid falling asleep on the job in the meantime.

As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a >50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty."

t3_1lpsaf,cc25ciq,"You say ""intelligent person"" like it is a inherent trait, after I illustrated that the vast majority of intelligence is actually due to unrealized and long histories of persistence/diligence. However, since no one actually meticulously observes and measures those discrepancies in effort/persistence/diligence for each person for their entire academic life, we attribute it to an inherent and invisible force. Just like physicists didn't understand how light traveled and attributed it to an inherent and invisible luminiferous aether through with light traveled in as a wave."

Without a doubt yes, but once again, based on what I've seen in academia, which is where the performance of ""intelligence"" is most closely regulated and measured with testing and assignments, virtually all of the success I saw came from undeniable and mindblowing amounts of hard work. To measure success in a meaningful way, let's look at accomplishments such as getting a very high-skilled, high-intelligence job, getting a PhD, becoming a doctor/lawyer, starting a wildly successful company."

t3_1lpmle,cc1kppg,"The point of this is that union membership often comes with a lot of perks. That being said, the big trend right now (in the US) to limit/break/bust unions is not coming from the individual level of businesses but is coming from the policy level with initiatives like right-to-work. Strategists have figured out that the single best way to harm unions is to decrease/limit their membership."

There's something really powerful in the duality there -- that Clark Kent and Superman are actually the same person, even if the world and the woman he loves don't realize it -- but that's ultimately a duality that's inherent to the character no matter what you do or how you tell the Superman story. How does Superman/Clark resolve his different halves, and should we see them as halves at all?"

t3_1l09gg,cbuio96,What they found is that child molesters don't really get aroused by children much more than the average person. Our usual view of the relationship between pedophilia and child molestation is that child molesters a subset of pedophiles (those who act on their urge) but this suggests we should think of them as two distinct sets which happen to coincidentally have a little overlap. So the child molesters are acting on an urge but it might not necessarily be a sexual urge like we think.

You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it. In my experience, the effect of drinking one beer is probably comparable to the effect of eating one dose of chewable Tylenol."
t3_1kye6l,cbtvo8l,"So this might mean you should drink in those situations. (Personally, I've gotten to the point where I no longer will have a drink just to fit in, but when I was 16, or 18, or 20, I definitely would do this.) But what about having more than one drink?"

t3_1kye6l,cbtwkat,"If you haven't experienced yourself and especially if you haven't seen much of it, I can appreciate why it might be scary. Most recreational drug users (and alcohol is a recreational drug) will probably come across some drug that they're curious about but scared of at the same time, simply because they don't have any experience with it. The most important thing to do in this situation is to set up a safe environment for yourself with someone(s) you trust."

t3_1kye6l,cbtzwlt,"My point is that Alcohol isn't bad, and it isn't good either. For me it's a nice occasional break from the normal day which I can have a few drinks with friends and be silly but not out of control for a while. It is also a nice warm end to a good day with a bit of aged single malt scotch that I can enjoy the aroma of as I breath it in and sip on it slowly to just have a nice warm relaxed feeling to end the day on."

t3_1iwnef,cb8sq7s,"The reason why is because our legal system and our standard of due process necessitate that people be allowed to appeal and have every chance to prove their innocence or contest the findings of lower level courts, and that means more trials and hearings over many years which adds millions upon billions in costs to the state's legal system. You could say that we should ""streamline"" the process and try to limit appeals and shorten the time it takes to execute someone to cut costs, but's that's basically asking to gut due process.

It's also possible that most of the money printed then has stayed with the banks that received it rather than fully entered the market, in which case it simply created more of a problem further down the road (not to mention: allowed banks whose unsound practices should mean that they went under to stay solvent and continue those practices."

This will make things get steadily more expensive over time - which if you think about it you've probably seen in your lifetime (lately though the trend hasn't been to raise the amount on the price tag of basic goods, but to sell a smaller amount for the same price).

t3_1hqd66,cax3idc,"Up until and somewhat through the 90s, there was a balance between artistic integrity and selling records. Obviously some people only cared about art, and some people only cared about money, but there was a balance struck between both of these things that was kept for most of the 'big acts' you heard on the radio. In many cases bands would put out one or two records under strict label control with ""hitmaker"" producers, and then once they proved themselves, they would be free to explore their artistic whims and put out really great records."
t3_1hqd66,cax3idc,"But even the early, ""reigned in"" records were often times still produced with a balance in mind. Look at Nirvana: Their major label debut, ""Nevermind"", was terribly overproduced by the standards at the time, but it still had a bit of artistic legitimacy to it. And then they put out ""Incesticide"" which didn't win them any friends at their label, followed by ""In Utero"", which was a really good balance of art and business sense."
t3_1hqd66,cax3idc,"At some point, though, the major labels stopped caring about maintaining a balance and started only caring about efficiency in moving units.

That's where Nickelback came from."

Now, if the question is whether a men's only hour should also be instated, well, that's a valid point of discussion, but on the question of whether women should have a safe place to exercise and become more fit, more strong, and more physically capable, without fear of sexual judgment or objectification or god knows what else (considering these are fears many women have to live with for the other 23 hours of the day), I think that's a completely justified policy.

t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"To back up to the quote from Dawkins: I would go back to viruses as a model. Viruses have an implicit game-theoretic calculation they perform via natural selection: they need to be virulent enough to spread, but not so virulent that they kill the host before they have a chance to spread.

t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"It's unfair to evaluate a meme's success by its ability to improve the propagation of the host's genes, for the same reason that it's unfair to evaluate a virus' success by that ability. Another relevant observation is that not every gene contributes to the host's survival - eg the large moose antlers that are subject to sexual selection but aren't beneficial to the individual, or the examples of genes that provide differential success by gender, so females carry the gene even if it hurts their own survivability, because it provides a significant benefit to their sons. So the relationship between genes and propagation isn't simple!"
t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"When you say ""the gene"" here, it almost sounds like you're saying that there's a specific gene for accepting and passing down a particular meme!

t3_1hhxrp,cavbnw1,"This is where the question about why memes are psychologically appealing comes in. We don't know enough about how the mind represents these concepts to have a solid theory of it yet (but I'd say something like our impulse to form social groups is an example of an element at the gene-level of meme theory). On the other hand, if we think of memes as heritable traits that can be put to different uses (as opposed to being genes that are biochemically determined), the theory seems to work."

I think this, at least superficially, sounds a lot like the argument against having homosexuals in the military and I think that is an assumption on the part of the character and actions of people we don't even know that we are apparently not making on the part of our faceless, monolithic group of acceptable male candidates that presumably make up the combat forces right now."

The problem with framing such meaning making as a fundamentally religious question is that religion in general, and Christianity in particular usually presents itself not as an answer, not as one partial explanation , but as a totalizing and exclusive explanation (what Northorp Frye, himself a devout Christian, referred to as an apocalyptic symbolic regime). By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?)."

(Obviously, some kids get there sooner than others; some make this leap quite young; but I do think that for most people , it's not until they have a good degree of agency in the structure of their lives that they can fully understand it.

t3_1gqfyr,camsoga,"I believe 9/11 was a big deal. 9/11 wasn't the justification for the war on Iraq, but had 9/11 never happened the war on Iraq wouldn't have either. 9/11 opened the flood gates for America's ""war on terror"", making it one of the most defining moments in modern history."
t3_1gqfyr,camsoga,"So when future generations read about this period of history and wonder to themselves why the U.S. had such a heavy military presence in the middle east, or why the government needed to ""spy"" on it own citizens, the answer they will fall back to will be 9/11. The fact of the matter is that America was a string participant in WW2, but never faced anywhere close to the damages faced by the vast majority of Europe. The U.S. has never fought an large-scale international war on its home turf."
t3_1gqfyr,camsoga,"So while you and I, not being Americans, might not feel as passionately or strongly about 9/11 - it has affected global foreign policy and been the spark that started full-scale wars in two countries in the middle east. As such, even though there is a never-ending onslaught of increasingly brazen terrorist attacks around the world, 9/11 by itself may only be a ""big deal"" for most Americans, but the consequences it has had are a big deal for everyone in the world. TL;DR : it is the consequences that 9/11 has had on the global population that make it a big deal."

t3_1gndd7,calvz87,"Also, you just finished claiming we don't even have it, so clearly you find it non-obvious as well. I could go on about others, but I think that's enough for now. More broadly, on the topic of your numbered items themselves, you seem to have missed the step as to why you think that, even if your items are true, this says anything about philosophy."
t3_1gndd7,calx3a2,"A concept not having strict boundaries makes its usage non -trivial. A philosophical question is almost nothing but something to be dissected, as that's the whole reason it's being asked. I'm not sure why doing exactly what it was designed for would take away importance."
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"I notice that - in general - your list is very light on political philosophy. Certainly, we could argue that 'individual liberty' is an artifact of human intuition, but I feel that this is an inadequate response - people's liberty  means* something to them, and professional philosophers have taken upon themselves the onerous task of describing exactly what that meaning is Under what circumstances are people unable to meaningful consent to medical procedures? Once again, people's capacity to consent  means* something to them."
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"by arguing that it is nebulous, and without clear boundaries. OK, I think I agree (but for different reasons). However the question, ""Does X know/understand proposition Y?"""
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"Sure, this will be a product of human intuition, because it is precisely human intuition that we are interested in uncovering! And sure, the line between 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' will be a Sorities-type line, but the Sorites-type answers aren't appropriate here; we know what 'grains' are, just not what is a 'heap'. Here, we don't even know what 'health' is, or what the basic units of 'health' are."
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"It also feeds into the debate on abortion. You discharge 'moral luck' with a 1.2 objection, but this is something sightly more subtle - it doesn't matter what our intuitions are because the state can always adjust what it pays for in order to keep in line with our intuitions about what the state is right to do. What matters is that we as a society appear not even to know what our intuitions are , and discovering these is a non-trivial philosophical problem."
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"A political philosophy question to end with - what is the role of the state? I guess you could dismiss this as a 1.1 or a 1.2, but that would suggest to me that you miss the nuances of political philosophy - nobody cares what the state  is*, they just care about where and how it should exercise it's power to cope with all possible configurations of the human conditions (cf Rawls). On the other hand, maybe I can't see the wood for the trees, and you're right to dismiss it!"
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"So my suggestion is that you pick a couple of the (to you) most philosophically interesting questions I have raised and refute my contention that they are meaningful (non-trivial) if you are able. I hope you don't misconstrue this as an appeal to influence - philosophy obviously influences the field of healthcare dramatically, but these are philosophical problems endemic in the field, not merely classical problems 'dressed up' with the language of healthcare.

Yes they might change their behavior, but wouldn't it be better they did so because they want to better themselves and improve their and their friends lives instead of them doing it because they hate themselves, feel ashamed and ostracized by society?

Yeah sure, the Japanese soldiers were evil, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the US military and its Allies were in the wrong for not letting Japan and the Nazis win the war and oppress many millions of people and murder lots of people.

t3_1gjdzq,caks2pc,"Ah, yes and no. The ability to do violence and the monopoly on violence, the ability to kill civilians, to create law and grant exception from it, can all be seen as violence and all contribute to the ""rule of law.""

Now, this legitimacy can be produced by violence, but still the rule of law is contingent on the internalization of the law by people.

t3_1g4ij0,cagti1b,"Most places will not consider you if you do not have proper identification or list the shelter or the Salvation Army or wherever place you are staying as the address on your ID. A lot of people want to work, but it is a scary and frustrating process when faced with not only all the questions above, but also in regards to the change of daily lifestyle and expectations that come with holding a job. If someone cannot work, the alternative is getting them SSI or SSDI, but good luck with that, especially if it is a mental illness."

There are programs for people that work with landlords or have case managers on site or help people with rent and utilities, but URL or, again, there is not enough room for people to get into these programs. If we made homelessness illegal, we would be basically throwing people in institutions which are already too crowded and understaffed and we would be limiting the chances for people to get into regular housing in the future."

Community-based mental health services are logical in theory, but the funding needs to be there in order for it to be effective. Cities also needs to promote coordination amongst many of the non-profits and services that are available, but it is hard to do that for some reason (maybe someone else can answer this)."

t3_1g4ij0,cagti1b,"Many homeless people have multiple reoccurring health issues that small community based clinics cannot fully address (in the city I live in there is free local health insurance that low-income individuals can get). Many homeless people need to actually be in nursing homes or assisted living facilities in order to address these medical needs, but they either do not have good enough insurance or the places that accept medicaid or medicare are all full. This same idea extends to long-term mental health facilities and especially to inpatient drug-rehab centers."
t3_1g4ij0,cagti1b,"Compound all that with other things like the stress of ""street-life"" and the lack of nutritional food available and self-care becomes one of the hardest obstacles.

In a typical blues/rock/pop/metal band, you have basically the same setup: one to three guitars (three live guitars is rare, but there are almost always at least 3 guitars in recorded music), a bass, a drummer, and a singer. Many bands have keyboardists, some have other instruments like trumpets or saxophones, but for the most part that's it - a band composed of 2 guitarists, a singer, a drummer, and a bassist can play pretty much anything from Chuck Berry to Cannibal Corpse to Adele."

So are drums music?"

t3_1fzbuj,cafam2z,"Another example of vocals filling a non-melodic role is older In Flames stuff. I already showed you one of their newer songs (their style has changed a lot), but in the old stuff they had 4 guitars in every song: 2 rhythm and 2 lead, with each pair of guitars harmonized to its twin. Between the 4 guitars, there was plenty enough melody to go around, and the role of the vocals was more to tie it all together than to add a 5th layer of music."
t3_1fzbuj,cafam2z,"When the singer kicks in, he is just as loud as everything else, only soars over it all because they're all playing fast and he just holds that note for what feels like an hour. Try to imagine that song with Aretha Fanklin holding a bluesy vibrato, or even Robert Plant singing ""ooh baby"" or something - those are undeniably two great singers with incredible styles, but they would seem absurdly out of place in this song. Anyway, that was a huge ramble, I can expand on anything you don't find credible or want to learn more about but it's time to shut up."

A vast number, I would claim an overwhelming majority of extreme metal bands are fronted by guitarists, and as a result the music is very guitar heavy."

t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"For now, let's talk about the additional dimensions as outlined in string theory. First, I will define them, but before even that, we need a fundamental understanding of Quantum Mechanics. ""Quantum"" comes from ""quantized,"" which means ""reduced to its most fundamental form."""
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"We can never know exactly how much momentum (how fast a particle is moving with respect to its mass) and where the particle is at the same time. This is an inherent principle which has been proven time and again, so I won't get into it here, but looking up Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a good place to learn more.

So when we say probability wave, we mean that the probability is bunched up in certain places, finite states where it is possible to find an electron."
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"This is actually how all particles exist. Ok, so maybe this has made no sense so far, but bear with me for an example. The double slit experience goes something like this: a single electron is fired at a wall with two slits in it, ---  -  --- something like that."
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"The past is the part of the wave equation which has already collapsed, meaning that the probability of past events is 1 (or 100%), while all future events are superimposed and have a finite probability. Impossible events are still contained, but have a negative or 0 probability (depending on your coordinate system). Ok, so now, let's talk about something even weirder, quantum entanglement."
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"In a similar fashion to how charge is the property of a particle which interacts with an electric field, spin is the property of a particle which interacts with a magnetic field. It is called spin, not because anything is actually spinning, but because the property mathematically behaves like linear momentum. Two particles in a system need to have different quantum numbers (charge, spin, etc) or else they would be the same particle (remember, the universe doesn't care about space like we do!"
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"Einstein referred to this as ""spooky action at a distance."" There are many theories for how this is possible, but I will focus on the one which is consistent to string theory. The entanglement collapses faster than light because once one it observed, it collapses in the past."

Coraline is a prime example of 3D being used to bring depth into a movie."
t3_1ejwsi,ca14g2z,"In the movie, when the main character goes through the portal to the other world, the two cameras used for the 3D effect were split further apart than normal, causing the viewer to feel distorted just as Coraline feels.

t3_1ehvba,ca0enap,"That is not progress. Talking about war as a ""natural process"" that ""eradicates old growth"" and contributes to ""human evolution"" is, I think, an overly romantic view of war. We too readily ask others to die for what we believe."

t3_1ehvba,ca0getj,"That's a trivial statement, however; death and suffering are the primary cost of war.

This doesn't even include the lost opportunity from those who died young and will not be able to spend the rest of their lives working and inventing."
t3_1ehvba,ca0getj,"I think you are also taking the opinion that war is the means by which social change comes, either by changing the social contract or by felling empires.

A war like the American revolution that brings about a sudden drastic change is easy to notice and easy to learn about in class."

These expenses can range up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is unlikely to be available in liquid assets for most, and leaving families on the hook for these costs when the dying person had the physical resources (perhaps a house that could be sold) to pay for it eventually is unethical."
t3_1edqbg,c9z8lj2,"In order to level the playing field and establish a meritocracy, I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on, and, crucially, at the same time provide services for health care, education, and child support through taxes so that even the poorest of children have a real opportunity to succeed. The playing field will never truly be equal, because successful parents don't just come with money, but with connections to other successful people.

Allowing the father to mandate an abortion would be ridiculous, the best we can do to swing back toward equality is to give men a comparable right: the right to give up all paternal rights and responsibilities as if he was putting the child up for adoption."

t3_1d93tu,c9o543i,"Too, it can punish a teacher for something out of their control - sometimes kids are simply unwilling or unable to perform as well as the state standardized tests expect them to, and often there's no good answer to that. You see URL happening more and more often these days, and it is due mostly to people who mean well but have entirely the wrong approach to how the teaching process should be handled. That letter is painful for me to read, in part because I know it's entirely true."
t3_1d93tu,c9o9bv4,"Second, I will say that I used to agree that teachers should be paid based on performance. Since, I have become more involved with non-traditional route teaching (so, I am becoming more familiar with the system, but I wouldn't gain anything by maintaining the status quo), I've since changed my mind on that fact almost completely. This is the part that I will mostly address."
t3_1d93tu,c9o9bv4,"If not, surely you know people who have. This might be mitigated by standardized tests, but standardized tests can be awful for a lot of reasons. I'll give you a real-world example: My old high school hired on a terrible Spanish teacher (she taught Spanish II) that didn't actually teach students... anything."

t3_1d93tu,c9o9bv4,"Beyond this all, this system is biased against those of lower socioeconomic status, who are shown to perform worse on standardized tests. I won't spend any time defending that, but if you're interested, you should look into it. But, imagine this: you are looking for a job, and one of your options is somewhere that the work will be much harder, you're almost guaranteed to get paid less, and you'll be blamed for all of it."
t3_1d93tu,c9o9bv4,"Meanwhile, you can go work at a so-called ""nicer"" school, work less, get paid more, and everyone will praise you for your hard work. This is sort of the current system anyway, but your suggestion exacerbates it. So-called ""bad"" areas already struggle to keep teachers around, so this just funnels more funds into ""good"" schools while choking out ""bad"" schools... which leads to ""bad"" areas being even less capable of receiving ""good"" education."
t3_1d93tu,c9o9bv4,"5. This is not really a point directly against your argument, but rather just a general statement about the sort of solution you're proposing. Education is definitely crucial to any nation's health, which is why it's constantly under fire in the US."
t3_1d7g4o,c9noa5m,"It makes no sense. The only other reason I can think of for why god wouldn't prevent evil is if life is merely a test that separates good people from bad people, which is inconsistent with an all powerful god, who would not only know which people are good or bad without such a test, but would also have the power to create only good people who would pass such a test. I'm not sure why a perfectly good god would create someone who can't pass his test, then punish them for all eternity for not passing the test."

t3_1d44p3,c9mxd9o,"This is not how antidepressants work. They are not happy pills that will make you automatically feel better, but rather they are medications that tell your brain to make the necessary changes to allow you to feel better.

If you need me to look up the specific citations, I can, but there are four studies off the top of my head that have seen this effect, separately headed up by Blackburn, Murphy, Hollon, and Keller, all of which compared the improvements of clients who had psychotherapy only, antidepressants only, or combined treatment."

t3_1cocdc,c9igpaa,"Here are a few reasons why the market for healthcare is not the same as a regular market, and hence why I fear the usual conclusions of economics do not apply: It follows a principle-agent model, so I have to trust that the doctor is providing only the care I need and not the care that is most lucrative for him (considerable evidence exists to show this is a problem even in the UK, and it is as beyond doubt as a question in the social sciences can be that it happens in the US)

 There is impossible asymmetry in the market; insurance providers cannot observe how healthy you are when you apply for insurance and patients are canny enough to lie if asked, so the result is that the healthy are under-insured, the ill (and elderly) are over-insured and the poor are shafted. Demand is irregular, and I can't predict my need for healthcare in advance, meaning I can't take steps to reduce my other consumption before I consume healthcare

 Production is irregular; I pay for healthcare but I want health, and I can't guarentee that my purchase of healthcare will result in health Avoidance of using the service is impossible (or at least very unlikely), meaning I cannot purchase a substitute to healthcare

 Moreover, when I use the service I am (usually) not a rational consumer - a man having a heart attack can't pick a hospital four hours away because it has better reviews on Yelp, and even if he tells paramedics he wants to go there they would be negligent if they didn't just completely ignore him. The profession is restricted by licensing, artificially creating an - important - barrier to entry

 Price competition is frowned upon - hospitals are expected to compete on quality and this is compounded by the way insurance puts a step between the purchaser and provider Your usage of the medical system affects my future usage (immunisation is the obvious one, following the events in Wales)."

t3_1cocdc,c9j13yk,"Just on the specific point of using Yelp reviews though, the actual system would have to be enormously more complicated in order that it wasn't distortionary. A simple example would be someone rating a hospital highly based on a 'halo effect' from the fact they had pretty receptionists and clean-looking wards while a much better hospital was rated poorly because their food was crap tasting but nutritious. (As an aside, the exact weight to give 'soft' aspects of hospital management like tasty food and clean waiting rooms in our judgement of how well a hospital performs is what I am working on at the moment)."

The point of the exercise was to show how the mechanics around material abundance influence what we see to be the realm of the political- in time, politics will change owing to increased industrial capacity."

t3_33x4zd,cqq3w8x,"With regards to the term tragedy, this is when the misfortune of one person invokes a catharsis in those observing, particularly a cleansing of pity and fear. I don't see this being strictly relevant in the case of a thrill-seeker meeting their maker unexpectedly, but this may be due to the public inaccurate use of language. You mention when someone takes up a clearly risky hobby."
t3_33x4zd,cqq3w8x,"You mention when someone takes up a clearly risky hobby. In many cases all we know is that a hazard exists, but this is not necessarily a risk as we do not always know the most likely (or maximal) outcome, or how likely these outcomes are. People attempt to estimate the risk, however we are famously bad at this."
t3_33x4zd,cqq3w8x,"Once we have made an estimate, we will do one or more of the four: Avoid the risk altogether: we feel that the risk is too high, and it should not be embarked on. This is my position with most risky hobbies, but not everyone feels the same way;
 Reduce the risk: some will undergo training, buy better equipment, research the activity etc. They recognise that the risk is high, so they attempt to reduce the possible outcome, the likelihood of occurrence, or both; * Transfer the risk: usually through insurance, people try to make the impact lower by transferring the liability to another body."
t3_33x4zd,cqq3w8x,"In this case 'volenti non fit injuria' does not apply: this principle requires a full knowledge and extent of the risk.

With regards to your final point about employment, I agree wholeheartedly, and in UK case law the principle of 'volenti non fit injuria' is often not applicable in these cases, as even though the person knows that the risk is part of the job, they often cannot fully consent to the level, and certainly do not consent to harm as part of a breach or failure."

Of course I can't see into their brain to measure if these people are really ""hurt"" or just pretending to be, but based on their externally observable behaviour, I tend to believe them. At this point, the proponent of this ethos can do no better than spin ad hoc explanations why somebody ""really isn't harmed"" even though he sincerely feels that he is, or to explain that when you hurt only feelings, it is not really ""harming"" at all."

Let me give you every reason that Kanye West is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat, who had provided nothing but top-tier music since his debut.

Late Registration debuted 2005, with a completely fresh Soul sound, and featuring the talents of Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Nas, Jay-Z, and of course Jamie Foxx in his smash hit ""Gold Digger"".

This album also has one of his most heart-felt songs Kanye has produced to date: ""Hey Mama"", his tribute to his mother Donda West, who raised him as single black mother in Chicago, with all the trials and tribulations that brought. The song is a beautiful display of a man who has a deepfound respect for the one who gave him everything."

Now I've been writing this comment for the past hour, so I won't even go into his non-musical exploits, but rest assured that as far as fashion goes, Kanye West is leading the forefront with his Red Octobers or Yeezy Boost Sneakers with a resale value of several thousand dollars each. Now, I hope that if you actually took the time to read at least half of this, you will see that the hatred for Kanye is little more than an attempt to marginalize one of the greatest artists of our time."

Essentially, it says that an action is morally good despite foreseen negative consequences if: 1) the nature of the act is good or neutral itself 2) the good is intended and bad is not 3) the good outweighs the bad Now, a utilitarian would only accept the third of these principals, but if you're willing to accept that these are morally relevant features for some other legitimate moral frameworks, you should be able to see the differences between the trolley problem and the transplant problem. In the trolley problem, all three points are fulfilled."
t3_332jn0,cqgxjbr,"Killing the man to take his organs also violates the second point, since his death is both intended and necessary to achieve the goals, whereas in the trolley problem when you throw the switch, the only intent is to save the five, not to kill the one. Again, utilitarians like yourself and other consequentialist ethicists probably will not agree that things like ""intentions"" matter at all, but I hope you can at least see there are some legitimately recognized philosophical distinctions between the trolley problem and the transplant problem, not just psychological ones.

t3_332jn0,cqh0rr6,"I disagree with you here. This is really the crux of the argument, and maybe you find it to be just a semantic difference, but I think it's a legitimate point.

It's foreseen that he will be directing it toward another man, but the training hitting that man isn't is goal, nor is it ""necessary."" If there was no man there, you'd still throw the switch."
t3_332jn0,cqh0rr6,"In the trolley problem, the death of an innocent man is a side effect of saving five other people. Again, as a utilitarian, I expect you to say that this doesn't matter, but there are plenty of other schools of philosophy that say that you shouldn't treat other people as means to an end. I mean, that's the conversation we're having here."
t3_332jn0,cqh0rr6,"I mean, that's the conversation we're having here. The first point of the double effect doctrine doesn't specifically say which actions are morally good, morally neutral, or morally bad, but in every version of it that I have seen used, it counts all intentional killing of innocents to be wrong. This was a doctrine invented by Thomas Aquinas, so obviously it is based on a lot of Catholic principles."

SJW is a derogatory term for someone who supports a valid idea but argues with poor logic and/or argues in a cheap, annoying, or counterproductive way.

Being able to afford visitation is part of it, yes, but there are other logistical problems with a move to another state. Even if both parents had unlimited money to spend on travel expenses, the mother's proposed new schedule would drastically reduce the time the children spent with their father by reducing the total time and frequency they saw their father (loss of Wednesday nights and first refusal rights plus the travel time),and give the mother too much control over potential visitation time."

This can be for several reasons, but the end result is the same; unengaged voters, forced to make a decision, even a non decision, end up punishing those who do engage. Why should your uninformed vote count for as much (or more, if I'm on the losing side of the weight of ambivalence) than my vote?"
t3_31wvvw,cq5skg8,"It's worth noting here that disenfranchisement and failing to vote are two very different things. Second, by making it a 2 horse race in a runoff where 40% want none of the above, you do nothing but reinforce the system already in place in this country; people who want none of the above clearly don't want conservatives; your system disenfranchises those voters, because if it was a 40 undecided / 30 conservative, conservative wins...why does a specific side get to win out against general distaste? All you're doing is making undecided be counted in the ballot box where currently they're counted by tallying up number of votes versus number of eligible voters in the US per the last census."

What if, due to the size of the universe, and the likely staggeringly huge number of habitable worlds throughout not just this galaxy but the billions beyond it, that we accept that there are other forms of life besides us. What if we then accept that at some point, some of these life forms will evolve such technology that death ultimately means nothing, and they have mastered space and time to such a degree that they would appear godlike to us."
t3_31olrn,cq3kosv,"Let's extend that. What if, given our limited knowledge of how the universe actually works, that there are spaces beyond what we can see where other life can exist, that each form of life occupies a specific area of space and time, but some have grown to the point where they can move across these areas? They would also appear godlike to us."

However, it is totally understandable that a group of people would construct a reason for what they see happening in the world based on what they know about the universe at the time, then pass that on through conquest, or being conquered, or simply merging with other groups."

t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"I will start with CMV1. ""Economic crisis"" is a bit of a hand-wavy word, but what it's getting at is the general conditions of a recession, which has a specific definition: it means negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters or more.

Edit: URL ."
t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"The notion that we use too narrow a set of, or even the wrong indicators to measure economic prosperity has been brought up multiple times in the discipline.

However, this debate is not GDP vs. people's feelings: this debate is about present value of consumption vs. future value of consumption."
t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"The reason GDP is a shitty overall indicator is that it doesn't say anything about where the economy is going - only where it is right now. For instance, oil-rich countries today may have a GDP of a billion zillion dollars, but once they run out of oil or oil prices crash, so does their GDP. Economic well-being, on the other hand, is meant to reflect an economy that can be reasonably resilient to the things life throws at it - a diversified economy governed by stable institutions."
t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"But many countries in the EU fall behind on issues like the tax burden, the ease of opening a business, dependency ratio (aging populations coupled with high fiscal obligations to seniors are a huge problem in countries like France, Italy, UK, by the way), youth employment, etc. The overall health of the economy is hard to measure, but generally speaking, the US finds it far easier to jump-start its economy after economic crises because it doesn't face legislative roadblocks or sticky benefits in any way at all close to how big these problems are in the EU. And US inequality does, nonetheless, drive hard work."
t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"And US inequality does, nonetheless, drive hard work. Without a doubt, the average EU citizen has a higher quality of life, but what we're worried about today is whether that quality of life is sustainable in the long term.

But that wasn't part of your premise, so let's move on."
t3_30kxn3,cpud2ds,"But each specific element of the first amendment is interwoven with the others such that one freedom can't stand while the others are denied. Freedom of speech is, if you understand it in its fullest and most abstract sense, the only freedom of expression you need, but if you just interpret it narrowly as the freedom to talk , to make noises, then you can control what people say in print and in other media, and your freedom to make noises suddenly means very little. Everything you're saying about freedom of religion could be said about freedom of the press... don't the other freedoms of expression clearly indicate that the printing press should also be free?"
t3_30kxn3,cpud2ds,"... or, why give a right to petition for redress of grievances, isn't a petition a printed letter, which is covered under freedom of the press? So to return to the original point - there may be ""penumbrae"" of the forms of freedom of expression which are explicitly mentioned in the first amendment which are logically entailed by the list of freedoms, but the fact that these shadow-freedoms exist doesn't mean we should relegate an explicit freedoms to the shadows. The only reason to proactively deny a society freedom of religion would be to scale back other freedoms of expression on the grounds that they aren't intended to go as far as the right to publish religious tracts , or the right to associate for religious rituals ..."
t3_30kxn3,cptw3vb,that's a deeply unfree and illiberal act. you can get around this with a general freedom of conscience protection but there are still problems remaining. and institutional church protections?
t3_30kxn3,cpu14tg,I was expecting you to argue for conscience exemptions generally instead of being limited to religion which seems like a decent argument to me. but you're just denying the importance of conscience claims which is just an assault on the basic foundations of liberal democratic theory. e.g.
t3_30kxn3,cpu14tg,Hence they cannot acquiesce in unequal liberty of conscience; they can accept only equal liberty of conscience. his argument presupposes we should want liberty of conscience but if you're denying that i'm not sure where we can start. i also didn't see anything relating to the confession stuff in your answer.
t3_30kxn3,cpu7c2g,why not ask that about free speech? but to sum up since my post has been scattershot: a strong protection of negative liberty: the government doesn't necessarily have to give you anything to fulfill your religious beliefs but it can't stand in the doorway and prevent the exercise of your rights. now even negative rights conflict in extreme cases i.e.
t3_30kxn3,cpu7c2g,"tell me if i need to explain anything ********* why not look at the actual law: legitimate here meant true belief: however, your example misses the obvious point that no rights are really unrestricted. We have free speech but i can't spit in your face and shout obscenities from the rooftops without problems. We have free expression but i (usually) can't walk through main street nude."

We have free expression but i (usually) can't walk through main street nude. you seem to be constructing a straw man where the only rights that need to deal with these super extreme scenarios are rights concerning religion and conscience (and your not making an argument against religious freedom your making an argument against conscience rights generally).
t3_30kxn3,cpu7c2g,"your simply asserting extreme conscience rights for non religious people will not have major negative consequences and it isn't true (say anti vaccine stuff or extreme environmentalism) no, what matters there is how far the right extends and our current system (which protects religion) imposes a variety of tests to see which rights triumph. your recognize we have current weighing tests but forget that the reason we have them is we consider both claims to be valid and in practice religious claims aren't as crazy as your counterfactuals suggest. and my argument is in practice religious protections are essentially just conscience protections limited to religious claims (well that + stuff dealing with religious institutions qua institutions) yes, the right not to be killed by another being (or sacrificed to pagan gods) clearly trumps the right of the religious person who feels compelled to find sacrificee (also boring because religious person at best would have a right to a human in general not the specific person's life they killed)."
t3_30kxn3,cpu7c2g,what's the problem? you think it's crazy but it doesn't establish a positive right for anyone. Bob's belief he needs a steak dinner every friday has no public policy significance.

Pet fur sheds ubiquitously anywhere the dog goes, in shedding breeds -- there are seasons where it's elevated for certain dogs, but this cannot be predicted and shedding never stops, just slows. Non-shedding breeds still can trigger allergies by leaving saliva on surfaces (although the risk doesn't last for long, if I had to guess, though an allergist would have to pipe up on that one), and anyway, shedding dogs are much more common than non-shedding breeds or crosses."
t3_30059g,cpo9jne,"However, just because mitigation measures are in place doesn't mean that it's a good idea to introduce more of a potential problem-particle into an area. It's like this: Sound medical reasoning often centers not around the conveniently simple idea of picking one big risk to reduce, but rather around the idea of identifying many many tiny possible risks and contributing factors and mitigating each one as much as possible to result in a cumulatively reduced chance of problems. Managing contaminants in an environment is a lot like managing pathogen cells in a body or managing chemical contamination in a lab -- you have to be thorough, or it simply won't be good enough."

Sure, some people are lunatics and have the potential to harm other customers, but people also have the ability to pay the restaurant for their services. This, due to the relatively low risk involved with allowing a human into your store, combined with the reward of said human likely giving you money makes allowing said human into your store a net benefit."

I mean, sure you can blame the kid, but you're the one behind the wheel with a licence that says you are responsible enough to drive, so you are the one who should be paying attention on the road at all times.

t3_2zpo9g,cpl5jg8,"The first concerns the cycles of employment that exist for congressmen, as governed by democratic (or arguably not so democratic) elections. As the general public tends to be under-educated with regards to the activities of congress (and its processes) and elections tend to be ruled by small passionate minorities of our population, it is in the best interest of those in Congress not to educate the masses or produce actions of substance, but rather to earn votes through gerrymandering (redistricting for the purpose of helping ensure likelihood of victory), gaining money (via corporate sponsorship), and passionate, but substance-less emotional appeals.

These people are also proponents of ""planned parenthood"" in a sense, but by their definition the very act of sex constitutes planning to be a parent, so abortion, sex ed, and contraception are all to be opposed by these people on roughly the same grounds: that they all acknowledge (or even encourage/incentivize) the use of sex for a purpose other than planned parenthood. In fact, the shaming of non-reproductive sex in these people's ideal society would also preclude (or at least discourage/disincentivize) the ""give birth -> give child up for adoption"" route, since this would require potential abortion seekers to publicly acknowledge the unwanted pregnancy and accept the attendant shame."

In each verse, Kanye shows how damaging this obsession is, from the woman naming her daughter Alexis or a Lexus (""She couldn't afford a car/so she named her daughter Alexis""), to ""It seems we livin' the American Dream/but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem/the prettiest people do the ugliest things/for the road to riches and diamond rings"" (both an indictment of celebrity culture, and the people who emulate it), and ""we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom/we buy a lot of clothes though we don't really need 'em/things to cover up what's inside/cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth"" another assessment of culture and Kanye's experience as a black person in America (really most people's experience) of being repeatedly told by the media that we should aspire to become more thin, wear better clothes, etc."

The title itself invokes a sense of wild lawlessness, which is supported by the religious references in the hook and the cultures both Jay Z and Kanye address ""I'm out here ballin/I know y'all hear my sneaks"" after three or four references to Greek/Roman philosophers, perhaps an attempt to juxtapose high-minded society with urban street culture, and ""we formed a new religion/no sins as long as there's permission..."

Finally, ""Blood on the Leaves"" is an incredibly powerful song, not only because of the classic Nina Simone sample from ""Strange Fruit"", a song about black people being hanged due to racism in the south, but also because of Kanye's attempt to highlight racism that still pervades American culture. ""All I want is what I can't buy now"" addresses Kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""All Falls Down"" ""We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom"")."

t3_2wd7g2,coq1b38,"Option A is very painful for you and has no effect on anyone else. Option B is very advantageous for you, but had a miniscule negative effect on a huge number of people. Furthermore, we can add that the negative effects of option B are ""lumpy"" - there is a threshold up to which lots of people can chose B without the effects being large, but past that threshold there is a tipping point where the effects are catastrophic, and then past the threshold, once again the size of the effect only grows gradually as more people choose it."

If all the people who are choosing between A and B are part of the group that is hurt by option B, this is a collective action problem."
t3_2wd7g2,coq1b38,"If all the people who are choosing between A and B are part of the group that is hurt by option B, this is a collective action problem. Everyone would be better off if everyone chose A, but if people are even slightly selfish , each person will see that he benefits enormously from choosing B, which barely effects him so long as it doesn't affect whether other people choose A. So everyone will choose be and make themselves miserable."
t3_2wd7g2,coq1b38,"So this is a collective action problem because the benefit that everyone gets from following a collective decision is larger than the benefit they get from the sum of decisions that make sense for the individuals (including, as we saw in the threshold case, altruistic individuals). Would you agree that in these cases, even if you tell the ""social justice warriors"" that you are only indirectly involved in hurting other people, you are just as involved as anyone else who has contributed to the problem, and therefore refusing to participate in a collective decision makes you part of the problem? Next, I would extend this to cases where the people choosing between A and B are different from the people who are hurt by B."
t3_2wd7g2,coqgbo8,"Just to be clear about the proportion between A and B in the thought experiment I gave, I was thinking about something similar to global warming, where my choices are (... a continuum between...) A: use no electricity or energy from greenhouse-gas increasing sources, and B: continue to live my normal lifestyle. In this example it's clear that when I choose A, I basically have to give up life as I know it; but when I choose B, I make a miniscule contribution to a problem that is hurting eight billion people , and if all eight billion people make that choice the climatic and sea-level changes will hurt us far more than the electricity helped. That is the kind of proportion between personal benefit and harm I'm talking about."
t3_2wd7g2,coqgbo8,"3. In a case where there is one villain who is doing something clearly harmful, and the social challenge is for the other people to find some way to stop him, ""YEWU, OYAU"" is most reasonable when the A/B trade-off isn't directly relevant either to the evil villain, or to the choice of how to fight him, but instead to a much broader problem with a pay-off structure more similar to what I originally gave (high personal payoff, harms spread among a large group, possibly with a threshold effect that makes individual altruism worthless). Then the A/B choice would be about something unrelated to the racist business-owner, and the purpose of the campaign against him would be that given that we've all chosen B, and this has horrible consequences for minorities, we have to find ways to help the victims: finding a way to get everyone to choose A would be one path, but finding other problems that people are hurting the victims and solving them, first, is often a better idea."

Basically, the fact that we all chose B gives us a responsibility for the welfare of the victims: the collective action problem, if we accept responsibility for the costs of B, is either to mitigate the harm (by getting people to chose A instead) or to compensate for the harm (by choosing other harms and taking a more active attitude towards them than we normally would)."

In terms of the Sherpas, I've actually done many years of work with indigenous populations in some of the absolute poorest places in the U.S. and I can tell you that while it may seem exploitative, for instance, for Native Americans to sell drums, pipe bags, feathers, and other trinkets to tourists (because it is both perpetuates misrepresentations of their actual culture and because it exploits and takes advantage of spiritual traditions which have already been significant casualties of war), surprisingly most of the people I've spoken to would still rather not have that small source of income disappear."

In terms of the trash and waste left on the mountain."
t3_2wc5yt,copid03,"What I think we can agree on is that the damage to the mountain is unacceptable and that regardless of why people choose to climb it, this is the underlying issue, not the inherent worth of the activity. I'm uncomfortable with regulating people's choices simply because I don't see the value of those choices, but I think in this case the relevant factor is that people's individual choices are affecting something (the condition of the mountain) which belongs to more than just those who choose to climb it. I would argue however, that the preservation of the mountain and the experiences of the climbers can both be accomplished without assuming that only one or the other is possible."

t3_2vks7u,coiju8p,"How would you feel if the special exemption waivers were used mainly for students who had held jobs in highschool? We could fairly assume that all the time they put into that job might result in lower grades but not be proof of lower academic ability, and we would probably assume that the dedication and ability to manage time shown by holding down a job while going to school in fact demonstrates qualities that make them likely to succeed at college. It's the same idea with athletes, the college is acknowledging that they have put huge amounts of time into developing a skill they are passionate about, and this may mean lower grades without meaning they are dumber, and shows other qualities that lead to college success."
t3_2vks7u,coiju8p,"Dedication, teamwork, time-management. It may be worth questioning why these special exemptions don't also frequently go to artists or students who work, but it seems fair that athletes get them. "

I'm not saying that schools don't consider their own financial interest in having a good sports team, but there are also good reasons why a college can expect that athletes below the grade requirements will succeed in college.

And obviously students who do a lot of different things also deserve recognition, but I think they are generally in a different category than student athletes or serious devotees to a single activity, for 3 reasons. 1) Doing a lot of activities at a lower level of commitment is unlikely to add up to the hours or strain of a really rigorous athletic program, half-time job, etc."
t3_2vks7u,coitob6,"At another school I did the same sport, also varsity level, which only had 90 minute after school practices, joined a bunch of clubs, played an instrument and altogether never put more than 15 hours a week outside of school into those activities. It was a lot of things and I felt very involved, but it honestly didn't match the stress of the first school and if there was a conflict or I was behind in work I could skip a club meeting with no consequences. I had much more ability to scale back my activities if they hurt my grades, by dropping one club or activity for example."

Someone who does several activities and has poor grades maybe demonstrates poor prioritizing, whereas someone who loves X but has to spend at least 25 hours a week to do it is more understandable. Club meetings were often during school anyway, and highschool clubs are generally really easy."

Whereas, if you are on an a more relaxed varsity team (one-a-day practices), and spending a few hours a week in multiple clubs, that doesn't tell me as much; you are fit and well rounded but haven't shown any special expertise, and frankly probably don't look too different from the majority of middle-class college applicants. 3) They do place an importance on schooling, they just don't use the standard admission requirements."

There are unique challenges and opportunities facing any minority group, but a big difficulty that LGBT kids face is the fact that nearly all of them come from straight, cisgendered parents, unlike children in a racial minority, who have at least one parent who shares their experience. Having LGBT community centers and safe spaces is essential for gay and trans kids to learn how to be gay and/or trans from other people who had similar experiences and from their peers who are going through the same experiences that they are."
t3_2tpl0x,co1i4k5,"If other discipline and interaction with human beings doesn't drum the violence and homophobia out of them, I fail to see how the presence (or lack thereof) of a few more subjects for torment would change the situation much, because it's not like such a school would drain every LGBT kid out of the rest of the system. I don't think it's one-size fits all, but I certainly don't think it's bad to have as an option, either, especially as an actual, rather than hypothetical adult gay man who grew up in a homophobic social environment and for whom such an accepting school (or just any kind of LGBT safe space) would have been a massive, massive boon, saving me years of depression. At the very least, every single LGBT kid should have some kind of place, either a community center or a school, where they can go to learn from and be around other people who share their experiences."

t3_2tct9j,cny4b3k,"1) Stagnation of policies: Since there are only two parties, each party collects groups from ""their side"" of the spectrum. The republican party gathers not only economic conservatives, but social conservatives, libertarians and the religious right. Looking at a single district (or state, or country) since a party either wins (51% or more) or looses the post (49% or less), extreme ideas within the party have to be eliminated, leaving the candidate a bland representative of the group."
t3_2t8798,cnwofae,"Simply put, everything about nukes are expensive. They're expensive to make (which we aren't doing anymore) but they're also expensive to URL . These are radioactive, corrosive, fragile things that require a LOT of security."
t3_2t8798,cnwofae,"The launchers need to be constantly maintained and kept in a state that they can be called upon instantly. The active duty stuff are massive rockets that require constant security and upkeep to guarantee that we can hit the button to launch with little to no prep time. All in all, it's just not cheap to keep these things shelved and ready to launch at a moment's notice."
t3_2t8798,cnwofae,"'Need' is subjective. I would imagine that everything that gets funded needs to not only survive practical scrutiny, but also political scrutiny. Both of which I think are hard for an average person to really comprehend and understand."
t3_2t6ote,cnwehlh,"And a lot of foster homes aren't great, even worse than the homes these kids came from in a lot of cases. In my opinion, the amount of people wanting to adopt and the amount of foster homes needed evens out pretty well, but the issue is foster kids are rarely permanent, so I understand the risk involved, plus taking an older child with tons of issues from abuse is a huge load to take on. But regardless, there's a stack of people who want kids and a stack of kids who need homes, and the closest thing I've come to a solution is in those stats."

t3_2sy7r5,cnu0c1p,"You need to celebrate the good individuals to inspire the next great man, or positive change is less likely to happen.

t3_2svygx,cnte9dh,"The band itself isn't the problem, the masses of fans are. And thus the band gets judged not by its music but by its fans; the hipsters don't want to associate with the fans so they stop listening to the music.

t3_2svygx,cnte9dh,"BTW, to dig up some Reddit history- the last such thread that I remember was URL . There were a few planning threads leading up to it, but it also ended with OP dumping his cheating GF in the most painful way possible. ~4500 posts was a lot four years ago..."
t3_2svygx,cntf1bi,"And while many of the top posts aren't really personal, there are a bunch of more personal ones if you scroll down. Now I get what you're saying in that since this has turned into a circus OP should pull the plug, but that's more for OP to decide than you or anybody else. Who knows, maybe updating this Reddit thread is keeping his mind off his problems."
t3_2svygx,cntf1bi,"And that is the core of my point- it's not for us to judge OP or how he copes with his problems. It's MAYBE fair to judge the people who post non-supportive things to the thread but I'd just as soon not judge anybody. Fact is, it's human nature to be interested in such things."
t3_2su6pz,cnsuxnr,"Movies are going for bigger and ""better"" and that often means CGI rather than live actors. This makes movies even less realistic not just that they look cartoony but that the reason they use CGI is to do stuff that simply isn't realistic. Can you really URL and think the movies were better because of these CGI sequences?"
t3_2sqh6c,cnsh391,"Most traditional cultures persist over the centuries because they inculcate a bigoted, intolerant attitude in their members that makes them treat reform as treason. One point to clarify: your cultural criticism can not only be thoughtful and in good faith and non-racist, but also true and important , but nonetheless it can still make you an asshole. This is because asshole is not an observer-independent term."
t3_2sohga,cnrg4rd,"J.K. Rowling wrote the most commercially successful book outside the Bible, and became a billionaire. There are billions of dollars of commerce that would not exist but for Rowling's writing some really good books. And her cut of that was not inherently unreasonable."

t3_2sjck6,cnq11eh,"The reason why Miiverse and Nintendo Network are the way they are, and why the Nintendo WiFi Connection was the way it was was because in an Iwata Asks segment, the people in charge of the online structure didn't even use XBL or PSN, so they didn't even take their designs into consideration. So yes, Nintendo is bad in this regard but that's because they're insular and not for the reason you gave. For Nintendo as a business and you as consumer, this would be the worst possible thing."
t3_2siye9,cnpvesh,"I think that's the point. It's not necessarily to say ""the bible is bad"" but more as a rebuttal to those bible thumpers that throw down verses like it's a word of god and end of argument. This is especially true of old testament stuff."
t3_2siye9,cnpvesh,"Aside from that, I think it's healthy to look critically at the bible as a whole, and understand that it ISN'T perfect. I'm no biblical scholar, but I used to be involved in church. I'd go so far as to say 75% is more or less useless for the layman."
t3_2silp9,cnpwwpz,"--- Edited: Took some irrelevant parts out... So if a human lacked something that would be needed to master a discipline, but not to learn it - would that also be due to being ""incapable""? For instance, I don't listen to any music."

t3_2sbnxo,cno79au,"If an actor can bring someone disabled to life on the screen and give a really faithful and convincing performance with due respect given to the disabilities that person has, what is there to be offended by who portrays that character? If they were to make fun of that disability, perhaps I could see your argument, but otherwise I'm at a loss. That's why I find it so odd you've ruled out practicality, because that is a huge part of it."
t3_2sbnxo,cno8skh,"It's much harder to find someone who is disabled and A) looks similar enough to start with, and then B) can play the younger role as well. Granted you could probably use multiple actors, some films do for roles that change over time so much, but often you run into continuity issues doing that which breaks that suspension of belief. Also, when you're trying to make a film using a disabled person, the unions and work hours become an issue as well, especially if you're on a tight budget or a deadline."
t3_2sbnxo,cno8skh,"Personalities and celebrity sell. If you've got a film with some disabled actor people don't know, maybe they do a great job, but people don't know the person, the film sells worse. With a big home name like Daniel Radcliffe or what have you, you get exposure to the film, and that can be a good thing!"

t3_2sagug,cnnmwvw,"If someone engages in fraud during that process and obtains citizenship they would have otherwise been denied, it would be appropriate to strip that citizenship from them after being convicted of the fraud. So I think the travel thing is a weak case for revoking citizenship, but that there is one case that's plausible: fraud in the naturalization process. When someone applies to become a citizen through the immigration and naturalization process, they need to meet a bunch of criteria."
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8scl,"You see, this is why I dislike the word ""multiculturalism"". People throw it around, but nobody actually has any idea what it is. Let's start with what it is not."
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8scl,"That's not strictly multiculturalism. Multiculturalism and relativism are based around the idea of tolerance, but tolerance was around long before those guys. The Mongols and the Romans and the Khalifat tolerated other cultures - as in, you could believe in whatever god you liked as long as you paid taxes."
t3_2s5c4b,cnnmmaf,"Cultural relativism is the belief that all parts of all cultures are just as valid as any other, and that all beliefs should be treated equally. Cultural relativism is a great mindset for helping people accept the minor differences across cultures, but it should not be applied to beliefs and practices that restrict human rights. For example: The culture in Saudi Arabia has led to the creation of laws that deny women the right to drive."
t3_2s5c4b,cnnmmaf,"It is a balanced mixture of the two. It accepts and respects benign cultural differences, but refuses to tolerate the ones that violate the rights of others.

While it has been a fairly long time since I actually watched the movie (and as such the details are a little hazy), to the best of my knowledge, there wasn't anywhere else they could get that particular part, and there was no way for them to pay Watto in a manner that would be acceptable for him."

t3_2rs57a,cnjforf,"You get a tax credit for driving the car they want you to drive, for building your house the way they want, for marrying someone, for having kids. Call it a tax credit, but that also means it's a tax penalty for NOT doing what they want. It just reeks of unfairness to me."
t3_2rs57a,cnjiwww,"The system is actually much fairer than most people think, because Worker A is not actually taxed at 33%. The money that Worker A makes over $189,300 but under $411,500 is. Below that, they are taxed at the same rates."
