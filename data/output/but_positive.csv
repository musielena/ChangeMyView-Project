t3_2rnr30,t3_2rnr30,"Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according URL the murder rate was ""extraordinarily high by today's standard."""
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"Your being mugged is a statistical outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part."
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you ""should"" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged."
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"I think you're correct for the most part, but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations."
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire."
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping."
t3_2rnfn0,t3_2rnfn0,"Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before."
t3_2rmy6e,t3_2rmy6e,"Not everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives, but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not."
t3_2rmy6e,t3_2rmy6e,"Likewise, most people's lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine; but, for example, cutting edge businesses (e.g."
t3_2rmwcd,t3_2rmwcd,"Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome."
t3_2rmwcd,t3_2rmwcd,"A person doing that is probably an asshole, but that does not mean that silencing him is a proper reaction."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"Every time a proposal like this comes up I am reminded of why it's such a bad idea: not because we couldn't do it, but because we don't yet have the wisdom to do it right."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"You've just laid out a manifesto for making the human race more intelligent, but nowhere in it have you questioned whether or not it's a good idea."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,I may not be a genetically enhanced superhuman but I do know that our bodies and brains are a dizzyingly complex array of interconnections and balances.
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"Separating intelligence into categories is a far better way to go about it, but by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories.
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement.
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"The ""Yeah but what if..."" thing just isn't going to fly."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are) No."
t3_2rkzen,t3_2rkzen,"I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect."
t3_2rkjr3,t3_2rkjr3,"Say you're right, and most of the people who post here are incapable of actually changing their view on the subject they're bringing up (I don't believe this is the case most of the time, but just for the sake of argument)."
t3_2rkjr3,t3_2rkjr3,"You said it was a waste of time because most people's views aren't changed, or aren't changed enough, but I wouldn't say that makes it a waste of time."
t3_2rkjr3,t3_2rkjr3,"I've read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I've come out with a different point of view."
t3_2rkjr3,t3_2rkjr3,"I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone's view was changed."
t3_2rkjr3,t3_2rkjr3,"Maybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn't that a good thing?"
t3_2rgs7o,t3_2rgs7o,It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.
t3_2rexe3,t3_2rexe3,"They're like coupons in a way, bringing in new customers and making them loyal by giving them 5-10% off, but still making you substantially more profit than if they'd not come in at all."
t3_2rexe3,t3_2rexe3,"If it was actually intended to repay some kind of service, it would cut into the business' bottom line, but the vast majority of discounts do not do this."
t3_2rekjo,t3_2rekjo,I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change.
t3_2rekjo,t3_2rekjo,That doesn't mean I can't try to reduce my impact on the world... but I have to accept that I will never be able to fully live within my own values.
t3_2rcsdh,t3_2rcsdh,"Unemployment is at 90% and you're a senior politician/a ceo with influence on the government - do you A. let 90% of people die from starvation and exposure, or do you B. redistribute the money being made by the active 10% to take care of them via mechanisms like regulatory limits on automation or a guaranteed basic income?"
t3_2rcsdh,t3_2rcsdh,"The economic collapse is plausible, but Gade's arguments are weak, not to mention contradictory, and his ""if.. then"" statements don't even follow a lot of the time - ""If the global economic system collapses, then the agricultural sector will have no further incentive to grow crops"" whut lol."
t3_2rcsdh,t3_2rcsdh,workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line.
t3_2rcsdh,t3_2rcsdh,"I mean, not looking at if your economics are good or not, but how does everyone die off?"
t3_2rcrkd,t3_2rcrkd,"Yes but your stated view is ""veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare,"" as if there are real people that actually think that."
t3_2rcrkd,t3_2rcrkd,Sorry but I think this is a strawman argument.
t3_2rawgb,t3_2rawgb,"The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech, but that couldn't really be further from the truth."
t3_2rawgb,t3_2rawgb,"In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them."
t3_2rawgb,t3_2rawgb,"It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over."
t3_2rawgb,t3_2rawgb,"Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you."
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"Now of course, this is a hypothetical situation, but you can probably see how this can apply to a regular game."
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"Adding items adds stuff that is done by neither Player A nor Player B, but instead done by the game."
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"That's why the only gambling games done professionally / competitively are the ones where the players have the ability to apply some strategy (there are professional poker and blackjack players, but not professional roulette players or slot machine players)."
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"And Henry Ford did not have the Ford Focus in mind when he designed the Model T, but aren't we all glad people changed things along the way so that we have what we have now?"
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"An inventor can create something, but once they give it to the world, it belongs to the people."
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,I'm sorry but adding elements players have NO CONTROL ON makes the game extremely unfair in the case of competitive play.
t3_2r6a86,t3_2r6a86,"You are right that some items require skill to use but most of them give a big advantage to the player (trophys, pokeball, smash ball) Even if there is a random aspect to the game...so what?"
t3_2r5o9o,t3_2r5o9o,"That may not be the curve you're imagining, but you haven't given us any reason to accept that your curve is the only one ""correctly"" described by the term ""learning curve."""
t3_2r5o9o,t3_2r5o9o,"It's not a factor of the difficulty (necessarily), but rather the volume of information that has to be learned in the very short amount of time."
t3_2r4u3k,t3_2r4u3k,"An employer doesn't only have to monitor calls, tickets or code, but also behaviour, and clothing affects behaviour."
t3_2r4u3k,t3_2r4u3k,"Of course they don't all need semi formal wear, but at least sandals, shorts, short skirts and vests and heavy metal t shirts are not allowed."
t3_2r4b8f,t3_2r4b8f,"If someone researches loss for instance, it may be easy to develop an academic view of the subject, but that knowledge does not confer what the actual experience of loss is like, or how difficult it can be to deal with."
t3_2r0eyf,t3_2r0eyf,"As /u/PlexiglassPelican mentioned, the Consequence Argument (i.e., we do not have free will if there's an absence of genuine alternative possibilities, or the ability to do otherwise) is compelling, but it only holds water if determinism is proven true."
t3_2r0eyf,t3_2r0eyf,"Often invoked here are Frankfurt-type examples, which attribute moral responsibility to an agent given the presence of determinism."
t3_2r0eyf,t3_2r0eyf,"I'm also surprised no one has mentioned moral responsibility, because that's an important factor in attributing freedom to a choice or action."
t3_2r07cv,t3_2r07cv,"This is the deep and inherent flaw to Sola Scriptura (as well as the fact that everyone just can come up with whatever they want it to say, but thats a whole different can of worms)."
t3_2r07cv,t3_2r07cv,"(You can't really actually change it with science, either, but don't say that to loud, people get threatened) The single biggest reason though, is that changing your gender is in effect spitting in the face of God."
t3_2r07cv,t3_2r07cv,"The curses of the snakes and men are not relevant here, but here's how he curses women:"
t3_2qzudy,t3_2qzudy,"This means that if somebody decides to harass people who have certain tastes (""First they came for...""), they can identify you This is not to say that streaming services are all bad (they are great for sampling for example) but in my personal opinion a large majority of their user base misunderstands the nature of the service and what they get (and what they give up) when they pay for it."
t3_2qy21w,t3_2qy21w,"I'm not going to address this after this paragraph, but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with."
t3_2qy21w,t3_2qy21w,"I think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise their child, but not someone else's."
t3_2qy21w,t3_2qy21w,"The current system you can eventually serve by publication, which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it, but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there, all of which take time."
t3_2quzrj,t3_2quzrj,"They could go to a library, but they have the hurdle of doing taxes at a certain place and time."
t3_2quzrj,t3_2quzrj,Yes it is a more complicated system but I don't think it is so complicated that it would be a major downside.
t3_2qu6fg,t3_2qu6fg,"I'm not a criminologist and I only took one class quite a while ago, but I remember this was presented as accepted wisdom at that point in time."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,Where it isn't a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead.
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,"It's about as far as you can get from your completionist Shepard, but taken with ME3's ending, I think it makes for a far better story."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,"A renegade lady who wasn't xenophobic as much as very pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests (and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops)."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,"Trust me, when you play a character who's a lot more of an asshole but who's a really determined asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it's worth something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,"Shitty failure Shepard's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she'd burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,"Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough, but I'd say that the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it is there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that's screwed up the whole way."
t3_2qslmz,t3_2qslmz,The 'but you see less of it if you do this other route' ignores that you can just play the game again .
t3_2qrlmm,t3_2qrlmm,"That sounds fine and dandy at first, but who defines what is morally bad?"
t3_2qrlmm,t3_2qrlmm,"That isn't to say that it would be better or worse than our's currently, but given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it."
t3_2qrlmm,t3_2qrlmm,"We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory)."
t3_2qrbaf,t3_2qrbaf,"I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot."
t3_2qrbaf,t3_2qrbaf,"I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time."
t3_2qrbaf,t3_2qrbaf,"And I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games, because these are things I want to know but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore."
t3_2qr8gn,t3_2qr8gn,"sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not the most important part."
t3_2qqxoy,t3_2qqxoy,"Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process (which I believe you've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well (if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM)."
t3_2qqxoy,t3_2qqxoy,"From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder."
t3_2qnu4z,t3_2qnu4z,"Well, first off, there's the fact that most people aren't interested in romance with family members of the opposite sex, but I figure you're excluding that."
t3_2qnu4z,t3_2qnu4z,"They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage, but how would you even quantify that?"
t3_2qnu4z,t3_2qnu4z,"If you limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women, then maybe you're right, but then again who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?"
t3_2qncj3,t3_2qncj3,"You can go to civilian medical school, and get HPSP which is slightly different but accomplishes roughly the same thing."
t3_2qncj3,t3_2qncj3,Other things that I've considered: I love the idea of a brotherhood but I don't agree with the ideology If you're not all in with the military you'll hate being a military doctor.
t3_2qmstv,t3_2qmstv,"Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out."
t3_2qmstv,t3_2qmstv,"When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success."
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,We share so much and censor so much less... but why is this necessarily a bad thing?
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,"It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment."
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,"Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man... but certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well."
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,"Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things, but the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of ""Great Awakening"" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin."
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,"Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways."
t3_2qmhw7,t3_2qmhw7,"People enjoy browsing other's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own."
t3_2qia6o,t3_2qia6o,"He could use an extra hand, but feels making a bad hire would be worse than doing it all himself."
t3_2qia6o,t3_2qia6o,"There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I don't think networking is one of them, the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"The status symbols change over time, but the existence of status symbols doesn't."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth, but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"Sure, a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a 2015 Lexus, but what's the point?"
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIV's outfit, but no one ever does."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"The cost to build a house may be zero, but land certainly isn't."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their wouldn't."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"Sure, you could use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor?"
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead.
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"You could put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you're better than that."
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"You could have a robot do your hair or nails, but really?"
t3_2qgpie,t3_2qgpie,"You could use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy."
t3_2qe6j4,t3_2qe6j4,"The senator might not have direct experience of what it's like to be a working person today, but does that matter as long as they have someone who can explain it to them in such a way that they understand and accept it?"
t3_2qe6j4,t3_2qe6j4,"sure, but guides and essays are not necessarily the same as personal experience."
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details."
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"Now, this is obviously extreme, but you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness."
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"I don't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is?"
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly aren't hard to make."
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"Exactly, my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes."
t3_2qc1rl,t3_2qc1rl,"J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought."
t3_2qbry8,t3_2qbry8,"You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, but it remains by definition a democratic one."
t3_2qb4ra,t3_2qb4ra,"A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end, but it's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill."
t3_2qb4ra,t3_2qb4ra,"The most beneficial trade I've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving ""immunity"" to that group."

t3_2qaf6l,t3_2qaf6l,"It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid."
t3_2q9fkx,t3_2q9fkx,"365 has few factors, so a perfect division is not practical, but we can at least do better than what we have: months 1-5 have 31 days, and months 6-12 have 30, for example (month 6 would get Leap Day)."
t3_2q8fd1,t3_2q8fd1,Two points that I believe is true (you might disagree but I would be willing to argue against it) Money is needed to raise a child properly.
t3_2q6k6o,t3_2q6k6o,"Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have."
t3_2q6816,t3_2q6816,"Plenty of jobs have down time where you are sitting at your computer but your next task isn't available yet, sometimes because it is reliant on other's finishing their work."

t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"No, he didn't let Katara go, but he also didn't let that get in the way of him being the Avatar."
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"She set pursuit of a relationship aside after Mako, but I think we all know that relationships tend to happen when you're not looking."
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"That's what I meant: It was an easily avoidable subject but because shippers (and not even necessarily shippers, but a weird authorial urge to give this ""perfectly capable of being on her own"" character sexuality and need for a partner), the ending was the way it was."
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"Besides occasionally knocking out bad guys, what major plot contributions did Asami have outside the first season?"
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"She was present, sure, but could the plot not have continued without her?"
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,Asami helped Mako do detective stuff in book 2 but was largely ignored.
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"Not necessarily, but they sure as hell shouldn't come the fuck out of left field in the last three minutes of the plot."
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"See, the thing is, they did had meaningful interactions, but so did every other character."
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"Tenzin, Mako, Bolin, her Dad, Aang, Toph, Lin, even Tarrlok, Amon, and Zaheer all had meaningful interactions with Korra, but they meant nothing!"
t3_2q5zwb,t3_2q5zwb,"I thoroughly enjoyed this resolution, but I definitely feel like she wasn't a threat anymore and imagine Korra saw this."
t3_2q4trg,t3_2q4trg,The reason we ban defences is the same as the reason for why we ban the admission of certain forms of evidence: not because they are necessarily wrong but because we don't trust judges/juries to use them responsibly.
t3_2q4trg,t3_2q4trg,"Not sure if that is still true, or true in California (it varies a bit) but I expect it is."
t3_2q4trg,t3_2q4trg,"Call me biggot all you want, but it is mildly upsetting, especially if I'm in a longish term relationship with this person, and they never disclose their past til after we have sex."

t3_2q4d38,t3_2q4d38,"I will say he could not beat doomsday who evolves when he is beaten and his jagged body would tear Wally to shreds when he impacts him, he also couldn't beat death (which is a cheap card I know but still sorry) More on doomsday He evolves every death he is a natural hunter and eventually Wally would run (pun intended) out of ways to kill him"
t3_2q4d38,t3_2q4d38,And again I am gonna cheat and say necron could beat flash since he can use the black rings and boom and entire army against him superman and doomsday can easily punch through his chest Also trust me I love flash (captain america more) and I agree he is incredible but what I truly love about him is he isn't godlike like superman he is kill able
t3_2q388d,t3_2q388d,"If the US really stood behind what it has done there wouldn't be any issue with releasing all the information on 'interrogation' they have - but they know that what they've done is heinous and almost certainly war crimes, so we're never going to see that evidence."
t3_2q388d,t3_2q388d,"That is the claim, but where is the evidence to support it?"
t3_2q388d,t3_2q388d,"I think my overall opinion is that it's good to be a good person and cooperate with people, but you also have to understand there are people who you can't negotiate with and you just have to kill (or torture) them."
t3_2q388d,t3_2q388d,"It might still be worth it, but if torture isn't that effective after all, the side effects might be too much."

t3_2mv3n4,t3_2mv3n4,I guess the point I'm making is that men don't feel any differently to women (which I think is what you're saying anyway) but society trivialising the experience to men and acting like they're fine doesn't help and just makes men feel less manly for feeling the way they're told they're not meant to.

t3_2jr2px,t3_2jr2px,"Presumably, the argument is that men aren't the ones who'll be directly affected by the opinions and decisions while females would be, but this fails to take into account that the bias can run both ways: one could be looking out for one's self interest without regard to a greater good."

t3_2jalt8,t3_2jalt8,"I tend to agree with you, but, here's some arguments that might change your view: All property is fiction."
t3_2jalt8,t3_2jalt8,"So, if you want to argue that the term 'property' is meaningless when applied to human-created information, you have to demonstrate that not only is the label meaningless for you, but that it's actually meaningless for everyone."
t3_2jaiv1,t3_2jaiv1,"Personally, I love the smell of marijuana, but that is probably due in some part to my previous use of it."
t3_2jaiv1,t3_2jaiv1,In my opinion people who do choose to do this are in the extreme minority of marijuana users but generally receive more attention because this is how some marijuana users are displayed in pop culture.

t3_2j7ldo,t3_2j7ldo,"But the world is also full of good things, and good people; the problem with getting your information about the world at large is that the news is far from unbiased; they decide what stories to run, and the way they decide that is based on how many butts they'll put in seats/how many issues they'll sell."
t3_2j7ldo,t3_2j7ldo,"Now, you might think that that's a bad thing, but I think that it is great that being kind isn't so rare as to be newsworthy!"
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,"Looking at your first link, OP didn't necessarily participate a lot, but every time they did participate it was to acknowledge a good point, and overall they thanked the group for providing a lot of useful ideas for clarifying what he thought (and indeed, he agreed eventually that giving to charities that supported the homeless was a better idea than giving to the homeless themselves, which is a significant change in viewpoint)."
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,We remove several more a week that have considerable OP response but that we eventually conclude OP is soapboxing about.
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,"As to your suggestion, it's not a bad one, but it has a serious flaw: the people coming here to rant are motivated to get their message across, and will jump through procedural hoops like this easily."
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,"In contrast, the people that are genuine, but kind of confused about their views will have a much harder time of expressing why they want their view changed."
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,"Or by contrast, do we accept ""My view seems to be an unpopular one, but I don't know why because it makes so much sense to me."""
t3_2j7gwy,t3_2j7gwy,"As for the other links, the second one has so little OP participation that if it were posted today we'd remove it for Rule E. The third one has only 5 votes and very little effort expended on it... which strikes me as basically a non-problem, but it raises an interesting question about your proposal when it says ""However, I really don't see why banning people from SPECIFIC COUNTRIES coming in for a short period of time is an issue.""."

t3_2j6uq1,t3_2j6uq1,"I agree that it's largely selfish to deny your organs or tissue to people who need them to save their lives, but I don't think it's selfish to refuse to let your body be used to make a political point (especially one you disagree with), or be used for research or medical instruction."
t3_2j6uq1,t3_2j6uq1,"Okay, but what if the organ is damaged only so much as it isn't viable as a transplant, but is still intact enough that it could be used for medical science?"
t3_2j6t16,t3_2j6t16,"I don't really expect this to change your view about the persistence of this standard, but maybe the historical context will at least help you understand how it came about and that it did kind of make sense at one point."

t3_2j3aav,t3_2j3aav,"There's a multitude of reasons this happens, often the cops in question truly believe in the guilt of the suspect, but the bottom line is that the cops behaving in ways we (the public) don't like are usually doing so based on this assumption."

t3_2gliyk,t3_2gliyk,"So yes, we probably should use nuclear power more openly, but it's going to be a very slow process to get to that point because of how depedant we've become on fossil fuels and how nuclear power works, right now."

t3_2gliyk,t3_2gliyk,"That suggests the rate of failure of nuclear power plants is a bit lower than 1%, but that is misleading because many of those plants are relatively new (I think about half built since Chernobyl), so the true rate could be as high as 2-5%."
t3_2gliyk,t3_2gliyk,"The nuclear industry's argument was that that sort of think might happen in Russia or a third-world country, but (minus growing pains like Three Mile Island) Western engineering and safety standards would keep us safe."

t3_2g3olf,t3_2g3olf,"You say inertia isn't a good argument for keeping a poor name, but so long as the goal is simply identifying the group, and especially in a region of the world where the variety and similarity of organization names can frequently be confusing, it seems to me that insisting on ISIL might cause more problems than it solves."

t3_2e4crb,t3_2e4crb,"You can definitely find perspectives from some of the founding fathers that support the view that the second amendment should act as a check on the government's own potential for tyranny, but that is true of pretty much everything that's in the constitution; you can consult the various founders' written views on everything and end up with a wealth of disagreement as to what purpose each article and amendment's should serve, as well as to their limits and purview."
t3_2e4crb,t3_2e4crb,"You're saying ""we're supposed to use guns to resist,"" but the response to that could well be, ""The government is obligated to use force to quash your resistance and the potential threat it represents to the safety and stability of the republic""."
t3_2e4crb,t3_2e4crb,"It's a thorny problem of recognizing that it's easy to support a constitutional right to violent resistance when it's in defense of a cause you support, but a lot tougher when it's a cause you find abhorrent."

t3_2e3t22,t3_2e3t22,It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more.

t3_2e3t22,t3_2e3t22,Having money and paying taxes does not equate to contributing to society; it rests on the false assumptions that all wealth is garnered from positive participation in the economy and that all money paid to the government provides mutual benefit to the people.
t3_2e3t22,t3_2e3t22,This example was thought of quickly but there are surely ways the rich could be benefited other than lowering taxes.
t3_2e3t22,t3_2e3t22,"The rich might not favor policies hurting the poor directly, but it seems plausible that rich people would tend to be in a certain age range, and then might start targeting politically powerless groups (18-25) for some kind of discrimination."

t3_2e1fah,t3_2e1fah,"I built structures with my dad, helped my mom in our vegetable garden (not livestock, but a similar usefulness of the skill), and I learned how to shoot through my high school on a competitive team (I have been to competitions recently where I am competing against mostly rural people who grew up shooting and hunting, and I beat them all)."

t3_2dwpux,t3_2dwpux,"And while many people are certainly capable of making the difficult but empowering choice to abstain, to force people to not drink is to A) strip them of the ability to make this potentially empowering choice, B) force them to abstain from something that, if done in moderation, will possibly have a net positive effect on their life, and C) label them as people incapable of making the choice and ostracizing them from normal society."

t3_2dseli,t3_2dseli,"For example, I wouldn't feel confident summarising what Derrida means by 'differance', but I know there's great resources that explain it incredibly well, and for the sake of having a discussion that's about more than 'winning' it's important to make sure that you're communicating exactly what you mean"

t3_2dsd7q,t3_2dsd7q,"Many of its followers do not subscribe to religious fundamentalism, but rather support the organization due to its pragmatic approach characterized by support for the short-term objective of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, while still maintaining the long-term goal of establishing an Islamic state that would replace Israel and offer a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem."
t3_2dsd7q,t3_2dsd7q,"In other words, Hamas was elected not only because it is considered an alternative to the corrupt Palestinian Authority, but also because Israel created the conditions that made it an indispensable social movement."

t3_2c6m3v,t3_2c6m3v,"When an essay is written later on the topic, those 30 people will primarily write rehashed versions of what was discussed in the debate, but they are primarily remembering, rewording, and reviewing what was discussed, without necessarily critically examining it, and independently coming up with new insights."
t3_2c6m3v,t3_2c6m3v,"In my mind, something like game theory would be a better extension, but I'll admit I haven't thought deeply on what one should do after they've achieved very high levels of critical thinking ability."

t3_2c1r9q,t3_2c1r9q,"For those in one of the highly westernized version of either religion, the argument against Satan is much simpler... God is the creator of all things, and is explicitly described as not only omnipotent and omniscient, but in many cases omnipresent."
t3_2c1r9q,t3_2c1r9q,"Maybe Satan is one he made to rebel, or spread free-thought and sin against him, but it is still HIS Satan."
t3_2c1r9q,t3_2c1r9q,"From all of this we can draw that most modern Jews see the 'bible' (Torah) and all the rest of their literature as a collection of tales to be inspired by god, but definitely a work of Men."
t3_2c1r9q,t3_2c1r9q,"However, much in the same way as Catholicism, the bulk of the religion believes that the stories of angels and demons and goat herders smiting their flocks with rocks and swords are allegories revealed to and experienced by a group of people that knew nothing but goat herds and mysticism."

t3_2bt248,t3_2bt248,"So it's understandable that a number of people who felt that way but either were afraid to come out, or didn't know that there was a term for how they were feeling have taken the opportunity to do so, which accounts for some of the increase in the number of people openly calling themselves trans."
t3_2bt248,t3_2bt248,"I certainly agree with your point that we should accept ourselves as we are, but you seem to be judging those who are identifying as trans as not being trans enough to be trans."

t3_2brzwb,t3_2brzwb,"It may end up being a purely biological process, as you propose, but it is premature to be certain that this view is right, and it stems (at least in my mind) from a failure of imagination over what may be possible."

t3_29pjwk,t3_29pjwk,"the problem here is a simple one of equivocation the primary issue is that ""authority"" in the common sense consists of people who have the capability to lie induction is based on independently confirmed observations over the course of as many trials as possible so far, we pretty much know that gravity is gravity because so far, while on the ground on planet earth, we have not observed an apple falling up a person who is considered an ""authority"" can say he's seen an apple falling up, and that's quite a different matter than whether or not apples actually fall up on a regular basis and that this fact could be independently observed and confirmed by multiple parties in multiple trials across the planet while it's entirely possible that one person may lie about apples falling up, it becomes (usually) increasingly more and more unlikely that people are lying when multiple independent sources attempt and observe the same phenomena when subject to a panel of people (peer review) who usually by and large would like nothing more than to prove someone else wrong science is self correcting... when ""I tried it a thousand times at a hundred spots across the globe and so far apples don't fall up, so I think you're full of shit"" is the response that comes from dozens or hundreds of different people, you can be fairly (although of course not 100%) assured that apples do not fall up and that gravity behaves as we more or less expect of course you are free to believe that apples fall up based on the evidence that there is a logical fallacy known as the appeal to authority and that you are effectively taking these people's word on the situation and so hundreds of people may be involved in a mass conspiracy to delude you - but I'd pretty much say that's at the very least counter productive, and at the worst kind of stupid in fact you are welcome to try your own experiments to let go of apples and see how many of them fall upwards (pending approval of funding of course), but my guess is that you will observe that they do not fall up and that if you do observe that they fall up there is one of several explanations, either you may have indeed found an anomaly (the least likely) or you are on drugs, or you simply have confirmation bias - and confirmation bias is a primary reason that things like peer review exist, because a person like yourself might not believe the status quo and may wish to try for themselves, and you are welcome to do so, and if you can provide a way for other people to also challenge the theory as you did, and also do the thing, and also see the same results, then maybe you've found an anomaly otherwise you're just crazy - of course you may simply be narcissistic and think that other people are not real or some such other oddity and so their challenges and retesting of the experiments don't count because they're all out to pull the wool over your eyes, but that would basically be psychosis if I've got my terms correct, and you would in that case be suffering from an equally problematic situation in which you think you are, but you are not, an authority"
t3_29pjwk,t3_29pjwk,"well, you have to draw the line somewhere, it's not appeal to authority in the same sense or in anywhere near the same capacity that ""appeal to authority"" as a logical fallacy is meant to be understood ""appeal to authority"" is more along the lines of ""bob is a mechanic and he says I need new blinker fluid"" - wheras inductive reasoning is more along the lines of ""thousands of scientists, myself included, have attempted this well documented and replicable experiement procedure and most of us, but not all have observed the same results"" pick your side, pick your battles - just because 1% of people saw apples fall up, even if they really aren't lying, doesn't mean that really changes the fundamental fact that most of the time you and everyone else notice that apples generally fall down you can't completely eliminate cognitive bias, but with the scientific method we can get about as close as possible to doing so and about as close as possible to a present time understanding of the truth having beliefs, that are based on the best available current evidence, that are open to change when presented with compelling new evidence, is about as much as you can do if you want to call that appeal to authority, then ok, but you've gotta draw the line somewhere as to who to believe and when, and peer reviewed science, though not infallible, is about as close to the best option a person has"

t3_29n4wo,t3_29n4wo,"I think shallow is a term leveled by people who are probably shallow themselves because of exactly this reason - that they know there are many people with whom they'd gladly and willingly have casual (but really nothing is ever casual) sexual relations and with whom they'd like to develop a deeper/further/lasting/intimate friendship/bond but they avoid doing so because of perceived social stigma and not because of their actual internal desires and also because doing so would likely preclude the possibility of being able to ""do it"" with someone better if someone better came along."
t3_29n4wo,t3_29n4wo,The simple reason for this is that friends usually have other friends they can go hang out with and don't have to put up with Bob's drinking but Bob is still fundamentally fun to hang out with and drink with from time to time.

t3_29n4wo,t3_29n4wo,"Maybe the warped view of relationships that the media presents as so irrationally necessary despite there not being great reasons to enter them has to do at least partially with the fact that the media by and large only really presents monogamy as the main viable option and with the importance of intimacy to the human animal, most human animals find themselves in a somewhat desperate situation to both fulfill their need for companionship and sexual release, but also stay within the bounds and confines of the standard social norms."

t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"You mention Arjen Robben and the penalty that he won against Mexico, and give the reasoning that it wasn't intentional as why it shouldn't have been a penalty, but intent doesn't apply in this case."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Robben does make a bit of a meal of it, but it is the correct decision, because regardless of whether Robben attempts to stay on his feet but can't quite reach it, or he lies around on the ground pretending to be dead, it is still a foul in the box which constitutes a penalty."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"For example, a team which is multiple divisions below another team (say Plymouth Argyle Vs. Man Utd) could meet in the cup, and despite Man Utd controlling the game for 90 minutes, a Plymouth Argyle 91st minute counter attack could turn the game from extra time and a probable Utd win, into a memorable victory for the minnows, something which is possible, but much less likely in other sports (including american football) due to how hard it is to prevent any team from scoring points."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Just watch the English Premier League title completely change hands in mere minutes, there is no other sport that can provide this much excitement on a regular basis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqgBONonE8 This video also shows the passion of the fans which is another thing that sets soccer apart from American football - i'm not saying that Broncos or Redskins or whatever fans aren't passionate, but they simply don't match up with the rivalries and the derbies in soccer (El Clasico, Arsenal Vs. Spurs, the Manchester derby, Brazil Vs. Argentina, the Turkish derbies especially, the Milan derby, the superclasico, the list could go on forever)."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"With this in mind penalty shoot outs should hardly be a big factor in your enjoyment of the sport, but also are exhilarating to watch anyway."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Had Chile won the shoot out, you may be singing a different tune ""penalty shootouts are great, they allow smaller teams to cause huge upsets"", but even as an England fan I enjoy (perhaps not the right word, seeing as it's so tense) the tension of a shootout."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"In terms of strategy, you're right Soccer isn't quite as tactical as American Football, but that isn't to say that it isn't a huge part of the game."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"However, tactics are often used in football to great effect - look at Atletico Madrid in La Liga this year, in terms of individual players they are far inferior to Barcelona and Real Madrid, but the rigid and structured manner in which they played, allowed them to win the league, which was extremely unexpected at the beginning of the season."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Watch the video i posted above for evidence, or the recent 2-1 win by Germany over Algeria, a game which was 0-0 for more than 90 minutes, but was an enthralling game."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Football players take hits sure, but when you're braced for it it's just not quite the same."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Soccer players flop all the time too, but a lot of their time on the ground is legitimate, since they play with their feet it's easy for an opponent to get tangled up and bring a person to the ground even if there isn't a lot of force behind it."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"As I recall, it was almost unavoidable, but it decided the entire game!"
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"The thing about this example is it was a weak penalty call, but when the player was brought down in the box he lost a legitimate chance to cut in or pass the ball to a team mate and create a scoring chance."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Not saying I like it either, but the players do it because it works often enough to be worth it."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Sure, no goals are scored but that doesn't mean ""nothing happened""."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,A perfect example of this is the Brazil-Mexico game which ended 0-0 but was a thrilling match none the less.
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Just like in football where it's not just about touchdowns, but interceptions, blocking a field goal, or getting a sack are exciting to see there are lots of things in soccer besides when the ball hits the back of the net."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,Similarly Ghana is a team well known for their power on the counter attack to catch the defense off guard and the United States was able to play around this by playing more defensive than usual so Ghana was in possession of the ball more than normal but they never really got a chance to turn around attack with greater numbers.
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"I've mostly already addressed the idea about the low score not reflecting how much action is in the game, but the one last thing I want to say is that the lower scoring games also make each goal a really big deal, which you can see by how much players celebrate when they do get one, as well as how crazy it gets when for the fans."
t3_29koa9,t3_29koa9,"Sure the show is often annoying, but a good ref lets the game flow and doesn't fall for the actors."

t3_24bof3,t3_24bof3,"It may seem as if its a wasted vote, but should those votes add up enough they do open up doors and possibilities beyond the two party system we have now."
t3_24bof3,t3_24bof3,"In the long run, FPtP systems tend to become two party systems; however, if a third party jumps up one year, one of the big parties will either take their positions to win over more constituencies or one of the main parties will die out in favor of the new third party (closest example I can think of is the Whigs in 1860, but this is not a perfect example)."

t3_248bcr,t3_248bcr,"This is because they have looked at the experience of going to a good club and having an amazing time on an extremely superficial level, tacked on some bullshit about making you feel like a celebrity, and neglected all the other elements that ACTUALLY contribute to how much a person enjoys that experience."

t3_23zsj9,t3_23zsj9,"Well yeah, ""lunchtime"" or ""sleepytime"" or ""morning"" or ""afternoon"" are all terms that would still retain their meaning, but you still have to figure out when these times would be, so it doesn't simplify anything."

t3_23xw5n,t3_23xw5n,"I could launch into a long drawn-out economics discussion, but the short of it is that trickle-down economics isn't working and hasn't worked in a while; to paraphrase the new Pope (and I'm atheist, it's just a good quote): the promise was that the cup shall overflow, and and that the overflow shall nourish the needy, but the reality is that the cup keeps growing so that there is never any overflow."
t3_23xw5n,t3_23xw5n,"I'll address as much as I can, but I'm running a bit nocturnal lately; I think we're in agreement on a lot; I should have said that I think a lot of people take their problems with ""the rich"" as a group a bit too focused on any one rich individual."
t3_23wvv9,t3_23wvv9,"They don't actively fight against it, but they do think that abortion is unethical due to the following argument: If it's not okay to kill a baby, but it is okay to kill a fetus, then there must be a time where it goes from okay to not okay."

t3_23wvv9,t3_23wvv9,"Technically speaking this doesn't rebutt your argument since it applies only to the current state of things, I thought my perspective might be of interest."
t3_23wvv9,t3_23wvv9,"Also, just a suggestion, but framing your argument to prove a negative creates an extremely high burden of proof on your part, and in general, usually but not always, I have found, signals a red flag that the person stating it has leapt to a conclusion without fully seeking out exceptions."
t3_23vw8b,t3_23vw8b,"The first criminal (criminal A in for child rape) isn't raped by karma or the universe, but by another human being (criminal B) who is now themselves a rapist."

t3_23vvzm,t3_23vvzm,It is certainly possible to teach students all the individual pieces and parts of the language (and we do try) but this is akin to teaching musical notation without music.

t3_23o885,t3_23o885,"This doesn't address all of your reasoning, but it's important to remember that one of the ""good will"" things that the United States does IS its military."
t3_23o885,t3_23o885,"If the Congress decided to (and the President agreed) they could shut down the military tomorrow, but we'd have a new, likely more tyrannical, government by Friday."
t3_23o885,t3_23o885,"We could definitely decrease the size of our military and still hold our own against any other country, but we also play a huge part in the defense of a lot of countries, like Japan, South Korea, and major European nations like Germany and Britain."
t3_23o885,t3_23o885,"Sorry if this is poorly written, but basically, those a three examples of countries where the government decided whether friendship, intervention, or war would be better for the country, and while the war in Iraq was a giant clusterfuck, I don't think they were wrong in believing that the most efficient way to get at their oil was to beat their government in a war."

t3_23lqtl,t3_23lqtl,"He opposes the concept of qualia, not because we don't have first-person experience, but because qualia as typically defined is incoherent."
t3_23lqtl,t3_23lqtl,"A thought can be apt or witty, but a chemical process cannot."
t3_23lqtl,t3_23lqtl,"Again, a physical process can have a temperature or velocity, but a thought cannot."
t3_23lqtl,t3_23lqtl,"Firstly, a mere thought is not witty, we might consider it a witty thought but ""witty"" is not adjective that can be given to the thought itself."

t3_23litg,t3_23litg,"I agree that social media is sometimes used when a real conversation would be possible and more meaningful, but for those who don't always have that option, as well as those who would like to create larger social groups, it's incredibly useful."

t3_23kv7b,t3_23kv7b,"I understand not wanting the body to look bruised and whatnot, but as I understand it, that's what a funeral parlor's staff is for, in part: applying makeup and the like to hide discoloration and other things for viewings."

t3_23jmyp,t3_23jmyp,"He did DESERVE a trial for his crimes, but he was in a heavily armed compound, and I'm fairly certain either him or the woman who was in the room with him had an AK-47 so the idea that he was standing there with his hands up waiting for the U.S. to take him to trial is completely false."

t3_2360o1,t3_2360o1,"Most of the people who face these problems don't really speak academically about these issues (due to education and cultural differences), but the academic term describing the combined effect is low Socio-economic status (SES) minority."
t3_2360o1,t3_2360o1,"That doesn't mean that being poor ""is worse"" or necessarily has the greater influence, but simply that you aren't getting an accurate view of the interaction between race and SES."

t3_22tn8x,t3_22tn8x,"I agree that tobacco will eventually become a non-issue, whether it be through pricing itself out of the market or increased awareness to the health effects from prolonged use of it (I think the latter will be more of a factor than the former, but I agree that both will factor into it's demise)."
t3_22tn8x,t3_22tn8x,"When alcohol was made illegal, it didn't stop consumption but rather created an underground market for it, much like the illegality of marijuana has created a huge underground market for it."
t3_22tn8x,t3_22tn8x,"It isn't necessarily that the legality of alcohol has a bearing on the marijuana debate, but rather alcohol is an example of a mind-altering substance that was once illegal and caused many problems which was legalized and solved these problems."
t3_22s6od,t3_22s6od,"You claim that other acronyms like MOBA and ARTS are too vague, etc., but including Aeon of Strife in the acronym is meaningless to anyone who's never heard of it (which is probably like 75%+ of the people who play games in this genre)."

t3_1lpmle,t3_1lpmle,Your first point isn't really an issue with unions specifically but with any large organization.
t3_1lpmle,t3_1lpmle,"That being said, the big trend right now (in the US) to limit/break/bust unions is not coming from the individual level of businesses but is coming from the policy level with initiatives like right-to-work."
t3_1lpmle,t3_1lpmle,"I realize that a lot of this is anecdotal and may not speak to other unions, but my view on the issue is that union labor works for some businesses and not for others."

t3_1ln8b5,t3_1ln8b5,"On the other hand, if someone does something bad but not technically morally wrong , we might be able to discourage that behavior by calling it undignified."

t3_1ln6cd,t3_1ln6cd,"There's a lot of debate in the philosophical community about what metaphors mean and how we should undertand them, but in linguistics, we understand that commonplace metaphorical uses become part of the word's meanings."
t3_1ln6cd,t3_1ln6cd,"The original meaning of concrete hasn't changed, but it has gained a metaphorical usage that to many people is no longer a metaphor, but rather is just a basic sense of the word now."

t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"He restrains himself as he hopes that people will realize how much better Communism is (as ruled by an altrustic Superman), but over time he decides he just needs to take the reins, until Lex forces him to realize that he's basically playing god and humanity no longer has any agency."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"Whereas Luthor represents the peak capability of humanity (Lex is at peak human intelligence and presumably physical training, at the forefront of business, technology and politics, and a complete master of his own fate), Superman represents the greatest good in humanity (accentuated by the fact that he has godly powers but uses them altruistically)."

t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"Some of these directly address your points: - Clark Kent's life actually sucks: The guy has limitless power and near-total indestructibility, but his life is worse because of it."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"As a matter of fact, choosing to do the right thing will often make your life a lot worse, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still the right thing to do."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"The guy's probably never been on a date, doesn't expect to fall in love or marry, resigns himself to the inability to build a settled life anywhere, and sees nothing ahead but an endless, bleak existence."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"Being the equivalent of a god constrained by human morality is lonely, but the alternative is being a god not constrained by human morality, which is infinitely worse."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"- The movie sneaks in a really important ""thesis statement"" if you watch carefully: When Clark gets knocked to the ground as a kid, in a quick but noticeable shot you'll see he's been reading a copy of Plato's Republic."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,- Nobody gives him up to the Kryptonians: There are a lot of people in Smallville who could've turned him over to the government but didn't.
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"There's something really powerful in the duality there -- that Clark Kent and Superman are actually the same person, even if the world and the woman he loves don't realize it -- but that's ultimately a duality that's inherent to the character no matter what you do or how you tell the Superman story."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"He has near-limitless power as Superman, but while running around as Clark, he has the same temporal concerns as the rest of us."

t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,"Superman's inability to be everywhere at once does nothing but dump the need to ""triage"" disasters on him, with the attendant question over whether he has the right to make those decisions at all."
t3_1lbmj6,t3_1lbmj6,That's why a good Superman story acknowledges this but demonstrates that none of that ultimately matters.

t3_1kxp5r,t3_1kxp5r,"Evidence is not the best, but it is accumulating in volume, is improving and in general it seems to be moving in the direction that sexual reassignment is effective."

t3_1kvk1r,t3_1kvk1r,"Sure, they may have been lying, and we don't ""know for sure"" whether it was really their intentions or not, but it's not plausible that they aren't, even though it's possible that it isn't ."
t3_1kvk1r,t3_1kvk1r,"That they're unequally distributed is perhaps a topic for another thread, one in which I would probably agree with you."
t3_1ktrbd,t3_1ktrbd,"Your point about choosing to have sex is obviously meant to solve these problems, but the fact is that not all sex is by choice and not all sex is expected to end in pregnancy."
t3_1ktrbd,t3_1ktrbd,"Similar scenarios exist when women on birth-control nonetheless become pregnant, or when a man claims to be sterile, or to have had a vasectomy, but either is not or didn't."
t3_1ktrbd,t3_1ktrbd,"In these cases the choice to have sex is made with a strong presumption that pregnancy will not occur, but it does anyway."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"Getting better than your friends and being able to post facebook photos which impress them and having them call you a ""great photographer"" is in that first level, but it doesn't mean that photography is ""easy"" or doesn't take skill, it just means that the first level doesn't take much work and you the bar you are comparing to is really low."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"There is still a whole world of really complicated stuff that is not easy at all, but critical for professional photographers."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"I do believe there is a valid distinction here, but confining ""skill"" to muscle memory is a bit limiting."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"For example, part of the skill of painting isn't just the physical motions, but understanding the translation of a three dimensional representation into a 2-d medium."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"This is similar to the intuitive knowledge that photographers must have, but instead of a steady hand to translate their idea, they have the knowledge of depth of field, exposure, subject composition, dynamic range etc."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"You know that saying: give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, but teach that same man how to fish and he'll feed himself for a lifetime?"
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"Paying for all those things, being squeezed at the bottom in pursuit of the interest you follow may seem underhanded and dishonorable, yes, but the photographers held in high esteem are teaching the rest of us how to fish, and so it is."
t3_1ks6p4,t3_1ks6p4,"There are the ones that know the basics, like pointing and clicking, but then there are the best ones, that can capture the essence of life in any situation like a rare orchid deep within the damp recesses of some remote forest or the child clinging onto a doll, a slim glimmer of hope amidst the ruins of a war-torn landscape."

t3_1kpcy7,t3_1kpcy7,"Summary courts-martial are tried by a single judge, but they're effectively federal misdemeanors - If you're found guilty in one, it does not count as a federal crime and follow you around for your life."
t3_1kpcy7,t3_1kpcy7,"A Special court-martial is also effectively a misdemeanor court, but counts as a conviction for a federal crime."
t3_1kpcy7,t3_1kpcy7,"You can appeal your conviction further up the military ranks, but not to any civilian court."
t3_1kpcy7,t3_1kpcy7,"I'm not going to try to say that the military tribunals in Gitmo aren't problematic, but they're going through a process that's atypical of military courts."

t3_1klm9f,t3_1klm9f,"I'm not discrediting the individuals throughout history that have been very influential in that regard, but people like Gandhi and Martin Luther King would have never made any difference if they did not have the majority of people on their side."
t3_1klm9f,t3_1klm9f,"I don't personally agree that the whole religious movement in Europe could breed a better society, but the principle of taking away someones opinion due to your own disagreement still stands - and that is what's so dangerous about all of this."
t3_1kkzei,t3_1kkzei,Power may be a source for good if it is used to help people but I don't see any reason to believe it is good of itself.
t3_1kkzei,t3_1kkzei,"You say that greed is good because it encourages action, perhaps that's true, but is it an action worth doing?"
t3_1kkzei,t3_1kkzei,"One should strive to be the best they can be, but that doesn't require power and greed."
t3_1kkzei,t3_1kkzei,"I would never imply that you should't be able to have a reasonable expectation of comfort as you need to look no further than Maslow's hierarchy to see thats a crucial role in self actualization, but to do so to the point of waste (referenced by the statue built only to be destroyed) is not conducive to human well-being and is not good."

t3_1kkvd3,t3_1kkvd3,"I'm sure you know where I'm going with this, but these are the people who are often called conspiracy theorists ."
t3_1kkvd3,t3_1kkvd3,"Now I'm not instinctively opposed to whatever they say--if there is evidence, then let it be examined no matter how crazy of a conclusion it points to--but the problem with conspiracy theorists is that they operate like religious fundamentalists."
t3_1kkvd3,t3_1kkvd3,"If I was to approach a religious fundamentalist (someone who mainstream religious folk would call crazy, or ""out there"") and try to convince them that perhaps God doesn't exist or that he does exist, but they're interpreting the Bible the wrong way, they would likely pull back further into their delusional, extreme thinking."
t3_1kkvd3,t3_1kkvd3,I'm not one of the guys who outright dismissed such claims--I'll give anything consideration as long as the evidence is there--but right now there is just too much speculation.
t3_1kkvd3,t3_1kkvd3,"Like I said, I understand the motivations and concerns of people who are susceptible to this type of thinking, but sometimes you just have to accept that the world is far more complicated than evil corporations who try to subdue the people, Bohemian Grove meetings about how to turn John Q Public into a slave, and shadow governments comprised of billionaire elites who fund the politicians to pacify the people with republican vs democrat."

t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,The URL goes some way to addressing this but there are literally hundreds of scales available.
t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,I suspect that a person can learn (though perhaps not be taught ) to be one way or the other (or the other or the other or the other ... etc) but at any one time people belong at a single place along the spectrum.

t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,I find it quite ridiculous to be told that I'm not really straight but somehow a repressed bi-sexual.
t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,Sure OK there's a spectrum and if one were to stand back far enough it blurs some and instead it'd be quicker just to say humans have 'sexuality and sex drives' ... but here on the ground I don't see that this is any of your business (until it is).
t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,"What use to anyone is it to say ""anyone can be broken""... Now I'm not saying that you should mind your own business, in the sense that I can call myself whatever I like, but rather than it's a distinction that serves no purpose - so why even make it?"
t3_1kj8ll,t3_1kj8ll,Any man can be enslaved but not all men in chains are slaves.

t3_1khlm7,t3_1khlm7,"Certainly, if you need to accelerate hard, you'll end up demanding 100% power output from both motors, but that scenario accounts for a tiny minority of driving."
t3_1khlm7,t3_1khlm7,why could they not build say the Prius with the more efficient but less powerful Atkinson cycle and not bother with any of the electronic bits.
t3_1khlm7,t3_1khlm7,"Because as gasoline engines get bigger, efficiency is lost as well (except at the higher levels of power output, but as we've discussed, that's a relatively small portion of overall driving)."
t3_1khlm7,t3_1khlm7,"*EDIT: Not only that, but the engine would be forced to operate at higher power outputs, which would cut efficiency, and you'd lose the regenerative braking and load balancing capabilities, both net losses for efficiency."

t3_304vk8,t3_304vk8,"I think that is a good reason not to have children too early, when you are still finding your own way in life, but once you are settled in a career (hopefully making a difference in the world), it's not necessary (or productive) to spend every waking minute dedicated to a singular job or mission."

t3_2ziiud,t3_2ziiud,"Various religious claims may have been found to lack support sufficient to prove them true, but I think you'll find that the difference between a believer and a non-believer often boils down to what a person believes is sufficient evidence to prove something."

t3_2z350q,t3_2z350q,"These people are also proponents of ""planned parenthood"" in a sense, but by their definition the very act of sex constitutes planning to be a parent, so abortion, sex ed, and contraception are all to be opposed by these people on roughly the same grounds: that they all acknowledge (or even encourage/incentivize) the use of sex for a purpose other than planned parenthood."

t3_2y2tk3,t3_2y2tk3,"Each individual protester may have had a varying level of knowledge about the topics, but the protests themselves were organized around particular, actionable positions that motivated the ""uninformed but angry"" to create a spectacle, and enabled the movement's leaders to launch themselves into political office."
t3_2y2tk3,t3_2y2tk3,"It's all well and good to say that the GOP was able to use their ""very strong conservative libertarian wing"" to turn protests into action, but that kind of paints the picture that Democrats don't have the same organizational abilities."

t3_2y1nt3,t3_2y1nt3,"But when Feynmann arrived in TN, he found that the explicit instructions had been ignored because the people in TN had no idea what they were doing and had stored small quantities of their product, well below the safety maximum, in eight different rooms.... but the rooms were adjacent to each other and the piles of enriched uranium were separated from each other only by thin concrete walls and floors."

t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"I don't think it's one-size fits all, but I certainly don't think it's bad to have as an option, either, especially as an actual, rather than hypothetical adult gay man who grew up in a homophobic social environment and for whom such an accepting school (or just any kind of LGBT safe space) would have been a massive, massive boon, saving me years of depression."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"I suppose the attitudes of LGBT kids with regard to identity might be worse than, say, having no preconceptions about identity and masculinity/femininity, but we don't live in a world that lacks these."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"Do you genuinely believe that that's going to be better than the environment in an LGBT-majority school, where there are not only more experienced peers who are more settled and comfortable in a variety of identities, but also adults who have an even deeper well of experience?"
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,Sure there may be an unfortunate trend of bullies not learning to respect their fellow humans' differences but what gay kid is going to care about the social education of their bullies when they have the option of taking themselves out of the situation entirely?
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,Yeah this could result over time in a negative trend but on an individual level do you think someone who is being tormented because of who they are is going to care about this?
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,Your third point has merit but still doesn't explain why having a school like this is a bad idea.
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"There will always be bullies, but a big reason behind the negative attitudes felt by people who are bullied has a lot to do with not having a support network or someone else to relate to."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"When there's a bully at a gay school telling a girl she's too butch, but she has 30 friends she can fall back on who will tell her that the other girl is full of shit, I think you can tell the difference."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"Worst for the bullied, certainly, but the bully is only going to carry their attitudes to the workplace or further education, all without having anyone to tell him or her their behaviour is unacceptable and shitty."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,I get that you're pointing out that it will be more good for the general public if bullies grow up knowing their behavior isn't okay than if gay people segregate themselves but far enough along in your argument at some point you're asking someone to be a martyr on an individual level and put up with bullying so that these shitty kids can learn a lesson.

t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,It's a tall order expecting a new school to undo thousands of years of religious moral conditioning but the fact that it most likely won't doesn't mean that gay kids who didn't grow up with a religion that hates them shouldn't have the option to attend a school where they will be accepted.
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"If this school was treated as a way for lazy officials to get bullied kids out of their way then I wouldn't support it, but I assumed it was an optional thing where kids who were get would be asked if they wanted to go there rather than forced out."
t3_2tpl0x,t3_2tpl0x,"Removing the bully seems the best course of action but the fear of retaliation against the bullied person for getting them kicked out is one of the main reasons this doesn't happen, and removal is the most extreme punishment they can impose."

t3_2tlyzs,t3_2tlyzs,"I understand using upper case and lower case letters and numbers, but requiring special characters, disallowing strings, or - in the case of one piece of software I have to use at work - disallowing double characters (eg 55, the Ls in yellow, etc) make it harder to come up with passwords and add needless requirements and limitations that don't add security."
t3_2tlyzs,t3_2tlyzs,"And putting limitations on how many times a letter can be repeated to stop people just setting their password as ""88888888"" or somesuch is sensible, but with so many words containing double letters, and several dates containing double numbers (11th November 1988, perhaps?)"
t3_2tlyzs,t3_2tlyzs,"As someone else has already pointed out, simply having a longer password in the correct-horse vein might work fine if the people trying to hack it are only using methods that brute force random strings of characters, but if the correct-horse method becomes popular, they'll start using a method that searches using strings of four dictionary words, maybe adding in names and places, and then anyone using the correct-horse method is at high risk."
t3_2tlyzs,t3_2tlyzs,"In summary then: I agree that some of the stupider requirements need to be removed, eg special character requirements and double letter limitations, but the basic requirements (upper and lower case letters and numbers) plus a longer minimum password length (12 characters, perhaps) with a bit of basic advice on password creation pages (don't use your name, the names of loved ones, or significant dates, use at least one word or string of letters not found in standard dictionaries, consider the correct-horse method as a starting point, etc - of providing a few examples of good and bad passwords) would increase password security while not harming memorability."
