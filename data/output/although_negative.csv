t3_2qncj3,cn7wgim,"Then you'll be sent wherever for 5 years (you're an officer, you don't really get any choice... could be Japan, could be Alaska, etc. ), although you might be moved around a bit during those 5 years too, there's no guarantee you'll actually be able to see the world. If you went the civilian route, you'd see as much of the world up to finishing your training, and then you'd have a lot more varied opportunities to see the world."
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Also, not only are some applicants bad fits for certain jobs, but some jobs are bad fits for certain applicants. Even if ""networking"" is just the employer telling the applicant about the existence of a job opening that they think would be a good fit has huge effects, without any kind of ""short list"" stuff (although at this point if they stop there, the company is probably knowingly wasting a ton of time and money with their ""weed out"" process on a candidate that they already are pretty sure will at least get an interview). Are you advocating that even this level of networking be discouraged?"
t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"If you want to dispute the advantage that already well-off folks have in resume writing and interviewing on the grounds that these are just skills that anyone could learn, then I feel like you have to acknowledge that networking is also a skill that anyone can learn. That wasn't what I meant though (although that sort of thing does happen and is blatant discrimination). What I meant was that the same underlying reasons why networking ""very clearly favors the already well-off"" as you put it also gives them a comparable advantage in every aspect of the process, including how to write a resume that gets noticed and how to present yourself well in an interview."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3ddwl,"This leads to you only being aware of the romantic failings of women - not those of men. Your confirmation bias is that, although someone else here has gotten you to talk about your womanizer friend who is easily as shitty as these women, it hasn't begun the process of changing your view about shitty adult-children being a gendered problem (or maybe it has?). On top of that, because you already have this dim view of women, you weigh their testimony lower than that of men (perhaps also because you have few female friends?"
t3_2orvv0,cmq18ik,"That clearly isn't true when homosexuality was fairly common in Greece almost 3000 years ago. The other aspect is that ancient Greece is considered to be an advanced society and a civilized culture, and the point there is to suggest that homosexuality isn't something that dooms a culture to fail, when it was accepted in one of the most powerful cultures in history (although I don't think this is a good argument). The other point you brought up with the animals is used as a counter point to the idea that homosexuality is unnatural, not to suggest that animals and their sexual practices are something to strive for."
t3_2nccrb,cmcd35f,"We dated other people while maintaining our friendship and never really developed any true feelings for each other outside of friendship. We have since grown apart (although I do still talk with her and see her occasionally), but from my experience it is absolutely possible to be best friends with someone from the opposite sex. "
t3_2n4aay,cma6qfq,"It has nothing to do with morality, and unless someone is doing something to harm someone else, they owe neither themselves nor anyone else the effort to change. It may be healthy to try to overcome triggers, and would probably help make for a more comfortable, productive life (although 'triggers' could be anything from mild annoyance at a smell that reminds you of your ex to suicidal thoughts), but there's still no obligation towards overcoming it. "
t3_2k3k0f,clhsvqc,"Even in my own work as an EMT, I am treated differently as a women. These attitudes are still harmful, even if we have won the same legal rights as men (although paid maternity/paternity leave for both genders would be beneficial for all). Even the NAACP is still continuing to combat cultural attitudes towards black people, long after they won their legal battles."

t3_2jpazx,cldtw4w,"If any media outlet is able to get the details they (and all other journalists) will publish the information because people have a high level of interest in these stories which leads to viewership and advertising dollars. Now, perhaps there may be credence to an individual committing these acts for the fame and noteriety (although since many mass shooters die in the attack I don't know how well we could scientifically test state of mind and whether reduced news coverage would actually serve as a catalyst for reduced mass shooting events) and perhaps we can say a media ban of coverage would be best for society as a whole. Where do we draw this line in the future?"
t3_2jaiv1,cl9x4n6,Sativa is like an energy drink and helps you get up which is great for depression. You can function normally (although you shouldn't drive) while on sativa or most other strains. Hybrid is just anything in between the two.
t3_2j3aav,cl849y1,"There might be other flaws in the system to argue about (quality of public defenders, abuses of suspects rights, not videotaping every interview) but being able to lie to put pressure on someone who might be guilty is a key tactic. There are enough protections in law to stop this from being abused to put innocent people in prison, although you would have a good argument that these aren't enforced properly. "
t3_2hfggr,cks5dxq,"This is because when I date I date a person, with all the positives and negatives that come with it. Finally, I have an issue with just declaring it, although this is more an issue with men being socialized to pronounce who they want to fuck constantly. For instance I don't think I've mentioned to anyone that I like black skin and I wouldn't have if it didn't serve as a point."
t3_2gly57,ckkjp8m,"People seem to find it very seductive that this country who's been bullied by the US has it actually figured out. Sometimes this rationale is directly influenced by the idea that it's against the U.S, therefore it's good, although that's not the majority of views. While I absolutely agree that the blockade is asinine/hurtful/criminal and should be lifted ASAP, it's not just America's fault that Cuba is in its current situation."
t3_2dn3f8,cjrqm60,"It would greatly change how light is controlled on roads, literally turning lighting bottom up instead of top down. We would potentially need additional lighting (although significantly less of it) for certain applications, but it would also mitigate light pollution. Changing the colour or dimming the lights in the current format does not solve the problem of unnecessary lighting, it just turns it down."
t3_2cotfm,cjhkm9q,"Evil is a word we use to describe the absence of good and/or intentional harm done unto others. So, although it is possible to review situations labeled as ""evil"" under a critical eye and gain understanding about motivations and intentions, there is still a time when there is more intentional harm/bad done to people than good in any given situation. Looking at the Holocaust is a good example of this (because, it's the internet and of course it was going to come up)."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Being one who has done extensive research on the conflict, I'd like to share a little bit in relatively easy terms. Israel was founded after WWII in May of 1948, although Jews were already migrating towards it since the 1890's(? ), at this time it was the ottoman ruled Palestine, and even before that in the late 1400's after being exiled from Spain, funny enough is they were viewed under a special status and thrived under Muslim culture just prior to this time."
t3_2c0frm,cjause4,"No, on r/antitheism you aren't going to be downvoted for criticizing popular (the Pope) religious leaders, nor are you going to find love for these people either. It was a topic in the community that r/atheism is at sometimes anti-atheistic and pseudo promoted Islam for a while (although I haven't seen this for a while) and there's little criticism and more so oddly protective of eastern religions. If r/atheism would be renamed to anything, it would be r/antichristianity."
t3_2ah2al,civg8t9,"But in the UN the US has veto power, and is preventing Palestine from getting recognition. Yes, although in this case I don't agree with the methods Palestine has used to fight back all the time. That's why the consensus is the 1967 borders."
t3_2afrhx,ciuoedf,"I work in a research group and the lab that I work in is located in the basement of a building, so I could probably get away with wearing whatever the hell I want to, and since I am transgender and will start transitioning very soon, that work situation is really great for me. For the most part, I agree with you, although when it comes to jobs that require in-person interactions with customers, companies have a right to have say in the image that they present. "
t3_29t2lw,ciorv42,"The problem is that a job pays between $90k and $110k per year, with women occupying the lower end of that $20k spectrum and men occupying the highest. Your hypothetical is also flawed because it makes it seem as though the appropriate response from a woman confronted with a significantly lower salary (presumably for no other reason than that she is a woman, although your hypothetical doesn't specify if this is the case) than the minimum compensation of what this position should command is to shrug it off and try to find better pay elsewhere. I believe that the appropriate response is that women should not accept discrimination from anyone anywhere for any reason."

t3_28sivx,cie3rwm,"Chess is acceptable for men, in the sense that it is something that is seen an unacceptable and uncool but something that boys who are considered as such would probably do. So although thought of as socially unacceptable it is a stereotype and the idea of a boy seen in the same light playing the game is not outside the comprehension of most people. A girl playing it however is something to remark upon, something to treat her as different for."
t3_28a4rk,ci90bbf,"A google search should turn up some good info. As for the stereotypes, most groups get something similar, although they may range from silly to offensive (worth mentioning here that being silly doesn't make a stereotype acceptable). Black people in the U.S., especially in the south, have some hateful stereotypes that need not be repeated, but also some less offensive ones, e.g., they like watermelon and are great athletes."
t3_27r91j,ci4g5dm,"However, if the argument is that smoking tobacco has a massive social value, then yeah, I agree. I'm a smoker, and I'd like to quit (although I haven't tried hard lately), though the loss of the social opportunities presented as the result of stepping outside the bar or party to have a cigarette are insane. If you live in an apartment building, you basically get to know every smoker in the building because of this."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"Even if they feel like they can't get out of bed that day, they'll know that you're thinking of them. As someone who, although faced with many hardships, has still been afforded a great quality of life in comparison to people in many parts of the world, and who is depressed, let me explain. Since others have already (in great detail) explained what depression really is: a disease."
t3_26dl3h,chqb2dv,"We're capable of feeling both pain and pleasure at a very high level. Developing fetuses do not have these qualities, although they are biologically human. In this same light, brain dead humans are biologically human."
t3_26388i,cho108e,My intent was to show that using police is essentially using state supported violence against people and thus should be reserved for cases where it is truly necessary. Stated another way my point is that although drug use as a whole may harm society drug prohibition also harms society as you will end up prosecuting and thus harming many peaceful and otherwise law abiding citizens. I believe that the damage done by putting people who's only crime is drug use/distribution in jail outweighs any benefits we may receive from drug prohibition.
t3_25gqr3,chhjcvi,"So, yes, religion and faith are illogical by the rules of the scientific method, but they were our earliest attempts at discovery - a representation of the human spirit, if an outdated one. I'm going to disagree with your assertion that gods are just a product of our fear of death (although certain ones are, and I believe that the Christian god falls under that net). Humans naturally seek to explain the world around us."
t3_22uku3,cgqivn8,"That's just not true at all. Tourism might lead to gentrification (although you have not shown evidence of this), but it itself is not at all gentrification. Some are, but many are not."

t3_21rsdj,cgfyezv,"And without that truer experience, you are IMHO less qualified to address the issues that Orwell addresses. Sorry, you lost me with ""although important and beneficial, reading books is not necessary for life enrichment and fulfillment."" So why do you think reading is important and beneficial?"
t3_2100tm,cg8cadv,"Many politicians during the 90's thought Sierra Leone was a lost cause. Today they are a democracy, and although still very underdeveloped, they are starting to see foreign investment come in, and a slow transition from subsistence agriculture to cash crops. For me, these examples demonstrate that political instability or even war cannot be reasons that countries are written off entirely."
t3_21006g,cg8jacm,"He could point out how often scales figure into his music, both explicitly and implicitly. He could tell her that, although the Western tradition is not the only musical system in the world, he believes it is the most beautiful and that, because she will have exposure and training in this tradition from a young age, she can be free later in life to combine that training with any number of other influences, and that, even if she decides that Oriental or African music is better, despite being jarring to her father's Western sensibility, at least she was able to make an informed choice. Rather than let her reinvent the history of music, her father is pointing her to the geniuses who already did all the hard work."
t3_20iv9v,cg44wwu,"The referendum, in my eyes, should offer four options: * Rejoin Russia; * Independence; * Stay with Ukraine but with greater autonomy; * Status quo. That way, you'd have a much fairer referendum, although ideally it should still be held in, say, 2016, providing a greater amount of time for debate. But without those options, I do believe that today's referendum is illegal."

t3_1xhrpt,cfby4iv,"Women were treated waaayyy differently for centuries and Islam did a lot to raise their status, although I would not say they are equal, I would say they have a different set of responsibilities. I guess the long top at the top is very comprehensive and although there are certain sections of it which I disagree with, most of it is true. I myself is a moderate Muslim living in the US."
t3_1xhrpt,cfby4iv,"I donot believe in ""modern Islam"", because then you are humanly adultering a belief system.

t3_1x9drc,cf9drsg,"The difference is that you weren't conditioned to except good of them, so you don't take note of it when they're bad. I don't think what's going on here is really that you are realizing women can it be trusted, although that's what it may seem like. Instead, what I see is an individual who is experiencing a crisis between two contrasting thoughts: 1."
t3_1t0eax,ce36rhk,"You claim that gay rights are not protected by the constitution, but human rights are; all citizens should enjoy equal rights. And although you may consider it to be unimportant whether two people who love each other are allowed to marry or not, a large number of other rights (as has been mentioned in several other replies) are conferred by marriage, including insurance, pension, visitation in hospitals, etc. The fact that two people can be fully committed to each other as partners, yet have no legal standing of any kind, creates ridiculous situations."
t3_1sclwf,cdw6eku,"It's about first seeing your child and raising him/her. I know there's something a little deeper that comes with biological maternity (and paternity to a slightly lesser although definitely legitimate extent). However, I think that children who are adopted (*especially* as babies) can develop an equally strong bond with their parents."
t3_1qw6q4,cdhrw21,"An example is ""Disney movies are heteronormative because they always show heterosexual couples"". If you replaced 'heteronormative' with 'typical' in that sentence, although it would remain true, it would lose its specific meaning. Therefore it is an example of a context where you cannot replace 'heteronormative' with 'typical' without losing meaning."
t3_1qgtma,cdcq77q,"Now, whether or not its inhibiting our mental well-being is another question entirely. Clearly the internet gives us mental stimulation that is unheard of in previous generations, and although I can't quote the exact study, it's true that pleasure chemicals are released in your brain every time you get a 'Like' on Facebook or a new follower on Tumblr, which can lead to the addiction you talked about. However, I believe this is just a new form of the desire for social acceptance that we have always craved as humans."
t3_1qfy2y,cdcikj0,"Briennes character defies gender roles both through her actions in becoming a knight and through defying the expectations of beauty her society, and our society place on her. Also I don't think Martin directly calls Brienne ugly or homely although he may describe her with features we think of as ugly or homely. Other characters call her ugly, and I think she has internalized that message."

t3_1kwoib,cbtll2e,"They made a movie about this called Hereafter starring Matt Damon, directed by Clint Eastwood. I'd be freaked out if I had this ability too, although I think you can learn to accept it as a gift. I'm a atheist btw."
t3_1kr8vj,cbru1c0,"In AFFC, the reader's eyes are opened to the truth. You realize that although Cersei is very powerful and dangerous, she really has no idea what she's doing, and her mental state is becoming increasingly unraveled. The reason it seems like such a dramatic change, IMHO, is twofold."
t3_1kr8vj,cbru1c0,"The whole speech about broken men given by that guy she's travelling with (his name escapes me at the moment) is pretty damn fantastic. So although it doesn't move the plot forward as much as I would like, her POV chapters aren't a total waste. And I couldn't disagree more about Sansa."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"That is true, and it is sad. However the reality is since the majority of the reddit population is male this is a more cathartic experience to them given they have experience this double standard in real life, so that although entertaining the same situation with the genders reversed would not give everyone the same tingly feeling. This isn't a good thing by any means, but I don't know if we could argue it indicates a loss of understanding of what reality is."
t3_1kf4rs,cbobp80,"Also, keep in mind that telephone landlines are extremely hard to take down. And even then, if all these systems are taken down there is always ham radio and wireless to coordinate response, and these systems although fewer are even harder to take down due to the sheer decentralized nature of them. Let's take for example, Google, which is, in theory, just a private company."
t3_1kcow1,cbnvkbt,"To a certain degree he was predicting the civil war at some point in the future. We are not at the point yet where you can correlate dollars directly into votes - a vote is still a vote, although arguably decreasingly less so every year under the principal you've just described. Will that trend continue to unabated for another 30 years until candidates can literally feed money into a vending machine to buy a legislative position?"
t3_1k5c52,cbll85k,"That said, if you are ideologically opposed to the public school system, you are free to opt out. Every state in the U.S. allows homeschooling, although the requirements vary for each. People are beginning to predict that the higher education bubble will burst due to the skyrocketing college tuition rates and the explosion of free open courseware available, and that it's very possible that by the time your children are college-aged, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education may be largely obsolete."
t3_1jmadm,cbg3yyk,"Any women who recently gave birth is capable of breast feeding. It's even possible to produce milk without getting pregnant, although it's not easy and does take time. Even if a baby requires it, it is not dependent on only one person for it so it's irrelevant."
t3_1jl2l0,cbfqlt5,The current limit is set at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks the fetus is viable outside the womb although it is unlikely to develop without being handicapped. Why exactly does this limit need to be shortened in favor of a limit at 20 weeks?
t3_1gtewi,cannxmk,"So your argument is that misogynistic dating advice for men is okay in light of the fact that there is a major deficit in dating advice for men, and that ""nice guys"" can find help there? Yes there is a deficit in dating advice for men and for now the seduction community is the only resource of decent size available (although there are other less misogynistic sources available), however, this does not justify nor atone for the misogynistic attitudes of the community. The advice is still misogynistic, even if it is helping people like you, because the possibility is always there that it could be non-misogynistic."
t3_1g912k,cai00qt,Additionally you fail to ask why all those traditionally female roles are less well-paid. Teachers' pay is set centrally so it's not just the market (although if something is caused by the market that doesn't mean it's not caused by the patriarchy too). Why do we value things women want to do less than we value things men want to do?
t3_1fm8eb,cabo09i,"The relevant difference with pedophilia is that children cannot give consent, whilst incest between parents and their chilren (including adult children) involves a power differential in the same way a teacher-student sexual relationship does. Homosexual relationships do not by definition include non-consenting individuals or power differentials (although some of them certainly can have these features). And yes I realise I haven't excluded sibling incest because to be honest the only reason I can see as to why this should be sanctioned is because of the genetic risk to potential children, so I guess if they use preventative measures its ok."
t3_1f9oa8,ca8tgxy,"The question is when life begins . If we have no qualms about pulling the plug on someone that is braindead because we agree that there is no life in this although the body is technically alive, then why does a fetus in that stage give issues?

When most people hear ""racism"", consider what ideas first come to mind."
t3_335312,cqhmvlk,"Not only does he have arguably the greatest discography in hip-hop but it also is among the best in the entire world of music. His first five solo albums are considered classics among hip hop heads everywhere and although his Yeezus got mixed responses, it is on its way to being a classic as well.

We're a partnership and legally family because we're married, although it wouldn't be much different without the marriage certificate. He has been my only partner since the age of 14 and we're both now 30."
t3_2u8hi5,co69ood,"The alumni of many ""sports schools"" go on to do great, important things in industry, politics, science, sports, research, service, the arts, etc. And although the media and TV may only focus on the sports, the scandals, etc., know that advancing education, research, and service is at the forefront of any decent university's mission. It would wrong to say otherwise without carefully examining the academic side of the university."
t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"But as u/Account9726 mentioned, French cuisine has made some major contributions to other countries' daily cooking, so it is not always easy to notice. I think high end restaurants are not a good representation of French food (although they are part of it). I would look instead at what is commonly available at the supermarket and the marketplace."
t3_2u7i4q,co5xcqu,"This, to me, shows how ""French cuisine offers the most creative and adventurous use of ingredients, has the widest variety of ingredients and flavors"" as u/nwf839 described it. The quality of the average ingredient and the dishes you find in a common french restaurant (not big chains, although they are not too bad either) are often of good quality. Of course that is also the case for Italian food, but France offers most diversity with comparable quality."
