t3_2rk7my,cngpiso,"Driving there is a 1 in 1 million chance that you're going to be killed in an accident, maybe a 1 in 10,000 chance that you'll be in an accident at all. You have a strange definition of ""risky""; while it's true a mistake can cost you your life, they often don't (cars have been getting safer since the 1920s) and the fact is that because so many people spend so much time driving, we are better at it than a lot of other things and so are much more likely to not make those mistakes (though, sadly, they do happen). I define ""risky"" as a high likelihood that something out of your control can kill you in the given activity, and the things that can kill you and aren't in your control to some degree in a car are very infrequent."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"I think that people that openly hunt down those they don't agree with online IRL are the reason people use 4chan and other anonymous forums. After a night of drinking even on reddit, I check my comments and prune them accordingly even though I only have a handful of friends that know who I really am. I don't want any of these fascist politically correct fuckbags bothering me IRL."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7kwnd,"I suppose some people might be satisfied with constructing fantasy scenarios with their partner. But it is weakness to post pictures, or weakness to decide that you are too ashamed or worried about consequences to post pictures, even though you want to? Are you saying that it is weakness to want to post pictures in the first place?"
t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"If you want to dispute the advantage that already well-off folks have in resume writing and interviewing on the grounds that these are just skills that anyone could learn, then I feel like you have to acknowledge that networking is also a skill that anyone can learn. That wasn't what I meant though (although that sort of thing does happen and is blatant discrimination). What I meant was that the same underlying reasons why networking ""very clearly favors the already well-off"" as you put it also gives them a comparable advantage in every aspect of the process, including how to write a resume that gets noticed and how to present yourself well in an interview."
t3_2q9fkx,cn4ebjb,"In Korea, for example, the year starts in March and ends in December. They didn't need to change the fundamental way everybody had gotten used to reckoning the passage of time, though, in order to achieve this end. That brings me to my main point: everybody is used to the Gregorian calendar."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her ""seemingly minor"" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu. I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all."
t3_2q4trg,cn2x9e7,"The religious person loses it and strikes them. I think this deserves some amount of ""heat of the moment"" consideration, even though for most people it would be completely unshocking or even hard to understand (""SO's an atheist, so? divorce him/her and move on"")."
t3_2q2cxc,cn2g775,"Something about one or both of these might allow survival somehow. All of these, though (and, I believe, any other way that humans could survive heat death), rely on physics that we don't understand well enough today to say that we know it's possible. By the physics we know today, it's impossible."
t3_2pxql9,cn1a1iu,"BUT, you do not have a case in saying you can pirate because it infringes on the right of people to develop things on this planet and distribute them how they see fit. We'd have to accept that in your premise that it is okay to pirate because: Even though you may willfully believe that you are compensating the developers purely for a vaguely similar value of the product; that is not what is happening in reality. The agreement and exchange you make involves all of the terms and conditions that they write out for you."

The spam filter can be switched off by mods at their own discretion, though, and even those posts/comments which are removed by the filter show up in the mod-queue or spam-trap where mods can manually approve them. That said, here's the main scenarios: ## Posts that are off-topic / break a sub's stated rules About 80% of all manual removals."
t3_2ottrr,cmqnqbl,"If aliens evolved through natural selection, my bet is they are quite similar to humans in the weapons, greed, mass extinction regard, or at least were in the past. ----- There are some good arguments though. The age of the universe is ~14.5 billion."

t3_2okad4,cmoaise,And I have never read anything that more accurately captured the dynamics of our families. Even though the parents spend little time on the page I felt they were spot on in every nuanced detail. The relationship between Hazel and her parents was exactly right; I got choked up by Gus's dad and he was barely even a character.
t3_2oihml,cmnioce,"tbh, i'm not sure about C informing B, especially if C doesn't feel morally in the wrong. though they may not morally in the wrong, it's quite ""shitty"" for C to ""backstab"" A. unless A may be potentially dangerous to B (e.g. trying to kill them for the money or to be able to get out of the relationship), there's no reason for C to inform B."
t3_2oihml,cmnj7aa,"due to the lack of standard, i use C's morality as its standard. EDIT: i understand why you can't agree with it though. i personally don't agree with it, but from experience as debater and from meeting different people with different values, i try to see others' point of views and analyse how their values affect their actions."
t3_2o66aa,cmkb48q,"By posting such a judgement on a public forum, they are implicitly looking for reassurance, and it is friendly and polite to reassure them. There are two flaws in this particular example, though I won't necessarily disagree with the basic concept. 1) You're completely ignoring the self-selection effect."
t3_2nxt7j,cmi1f55,"I'm glad you made that connection for me. Again though, I want to reiterate that defense of property is not, legally, morally or otherwise, justification for ending a human life. The common link here is, of course, the idea that a threat to my life justifies ending yours."
t3_2nvxqw,cmhezg8,"And I genuinely hope it all works out for you both. You don't know it would last, though. That's my only contention."
t3_2nid9k,cmdv5rc,"Maybe what you saw was just boring or bad. In another time and place it might be good though because the audience's expectations changes. If we lived in a world where only realistic depictions of things were seen (and written about, etc..) then some nonsense smears might jostle us out of that box."
t3_2nid9k,cmdv5rc,"If we lived in a world where only realistic depictions of things were seen (and written about, etc..) then some nonsense smears might jostle us out of that box. I'm no expert though. I kinda agree with you that the airy-faery stuff doesn't do anything for me."
t3_2n900k,cmld565,"You have to show how the government came to own everything. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction#Corporate_personhood Basically, the government treats corporations as people, even though that's not logical (but the government controls the court system, so legally they're people) I'd like to challenge your belief that a company can become a monopoly by cutting prices way below profit for an extended period of time and recover enough afterward to keep all other potential competitors out. Many people believe this, but we shouldn't base our beliefs on what others think."
t3_2n8psp,cmbzbs2,But it did come along. And it came along even though I wasn't looking for it. (I wasn't against it.
t3_2mv3n4,cm82ay0,"then it was rape!"" even though it really does not read like a rape account. I do think some people are too eager to label encounters ""rape"", and that can definitely make people feel worse than they need to."
t3_2lzhcj,clzoxqm,"Changing a photo on facebook is more akin to bringing donuts to the office on your birthday. Even though I'm not obligated to wish them a happy birthday, I like to do it anyways. I absolutely happy to give people special treatment one or two days a year, beyond that it gets tiresome."
t3_2kypt8,clpzajn,"Kind of like roads in major cities have tools / congestion charges. I think though you're focused on the pricing model and missing the larger issue - that it's time for telecoms to be nationalized in the US. If you happen to live in the US, your bill is high because companies are geographic monopolies that can charge pretty exorbitant numbers."
t3_2kuu7n,clp3n3x,"It really all comes down to what people are willing to spend. If I want to purchase something for $10 even though it only costed 5 cents to produce, why not allow me? "
t3_2kuu7n,cloyjd8,"We are people that want shit and want it NOW! More money = more better and we gotta look good in our fancy sports cars that can go 250 mph even though the highway speed limit is 55 mph. If consumers wanted to put a profit cap on corporations, they could do so in an instant simply by closing their wallets."
t3_2kkqbm,clm9hyb,"I'm glad to see you putting so much thought into this issue. Please remember though, that all of my stated benefits to having children can be gained by helping to raise any children. http://www.bigbrothersbigsisters.ca/en/home/default.aspx"
t3_2kko3q,clmew0k,"They thought it'd be the reemergence of a monarchy style tyranny. Think about it though, which do you consider a bigger influence on our system today, corporations and lobbyists and special interest groups, or monarchs? I don't think there's any way for the founding fathers to have reliably predicted the extent of the influence corporations would have on politics."
t3_2k3k0f,clhnpfj,"I never said otherwise. They aren't mutually exclusive though. You wouldn't tell a black rights activist that they need to ""abandon"" their movement and join everyone else."

t3_2jhdaw,clbr1hn,"You know better than I, but my impression is that if the server cannot make at least minimum wage on tips alone, they will be paid that amount anyway by the restaurant. So, you're not actually stiffing them, though I'm sure management will question why they don't get tips and eventually discuss with them their poor behavior and habits. Also, they don't know you, nor can they read your mind, so they have no idea how great of a tipper you are otherwise and just assume you never tip, or something."
t3_2jgtvo,clbm2rj,"I won't argue that it's good for taxpayers, I think it probably is in most ways. I think you're ignoring the other side of it though. It removes the ""right"" to collectively bargain for the public employees and is bad for them."
t3_2j3b5u,cl95hhw,"It's very different to eat 20 doughnuts as part of a competition, or to make myself feel comforted, or because I might never have any more, or because I feel deprived, or because I hate myself so might as well, or because once I've crossed a barrier I may as well go the whole hog..... I also think your comment about 'failing' is interesting - as though food is a test or exam. That what you do or don't eat is a reflection on you in some way."

t3_2ixatz,cl6g9da,"Remember without a star in proximity the temperature would constantly be dropping. At this point let's bring back in my first reason- we haven't yet found any evidence that intelligent life exists anywhere but here on earth so the likely hood of any aliens coming from a nearby star is incredibly low, otherwise we would have seen evidence of their existence before now- though I do admit it's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack, the same odds are against the hopeful invaders. So to sum up- What would be the point of travelling an enormous distance and consuming an enormous amount of resource to come and kill us- to steal our resource?"
t3_2ir1vh,cl4qfr4,"The problem is that almost everyone describes themselves as egalitarian (at least publicly). Even though feminists would describe themselves as egalitarian, if egalitarian is a blanket term that describes both feminists and MRA folks who they strongly disagree with, its not a useful term to distinguish feminists from others who are in practice hold very different views. "
t3_2i6sq2,ckzpzfm,"Those examples you listed are isolated incidents and I agree don't really have much weight in this discussion. I disagree that singling out feminists isn't warranted though. In the case what we're talking about here is a large, international effort to inject feminist ideology into Wikipedia at large, which is in fact a direct threat to it's objectivity, and in some cases reliability due to articles being removed (Thomas James Ball comes to mind, which admittedly predates this academia infiltration)."
t3_2i0v1l,cky4z54,"But there's diminishing returns. The difference between working on your future career 90% of the time versus 100% is very small compared to 0% versus 10%, even though it is the same amount of time. As long as you put in decent effort, that's the bulk of the future value."

t3_2hr75i,ckv9rr3,"They charge men more because they want to stack the deck in their favor, because otherwise they wouldn't make a profit and wouldn't exist. In hiring though, you don't have to deal with hundreds of thousands of people. You're talking about one employee."
t3_2ho91q,ckuip0j,"If they do get a ticket, lots of people will be outraged when they hear that. In a sense, though, you're right. You are not required to ever be nice to anyone."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"Sure. It's certainly not easy though. You have to deal with a much much farther starting-point than most, and, to top that off, there are all sorts of obstacles in your way (such as the difficulty in obtaining an education with less money, a legal system that actively makes it harder for you to succeed, a lack of initial capital with which to try new things, the list goes on)."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"which screams ""equality of outcome"" to me, rather than ""equality of opportunity."" This out of the way, though, I shall now address specific points in the above context. Ideally, an egalitarian society would start everyone on the same footing per se, but that does not involve what you're assigning to it."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"If you mean that the same rules would be applied to everyone equally, I'd say that seems fairly obvious. If, though, you mean that ""you get exactly these resources, which are identical to those everyone else gets, no more and no less,"" that seems rather counterproductive; this removes the incentive to advance oneself. More reasonably, it would be ensured that certain provisions were applied equally across society, while starting-point had less of an effect on advancement."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrhavj,"No walking around to reform their line or anything. It seems like there's still strategizing (though with less time to think about it), and there's still the kinds of skills you mention (except it doesn't sound to me like there's as much specialization in rugby, so these are skills that most of the players have the learn, not just a few of them). edit: Meant to include a link to a comparison: http://www.diffen.com/difference/American_Football_vs_Rugby"
t3_2gzyj0,ckok1e7,"I was in Boston when the marathon bombings happened. Terrorism affected everyone on the streets, even though only 3 people were killed. The scope of an act of terrorism is much greater than the strict number of casualties."
t3_2gly57,ckkjp8m,"and so on. In short, I'll put it this way, if we did trade with them, I could see it being much like Laos, in that you don't see too many naive westerners defending Lao's current system of government, even though they're also socialist. TL;DR: The situation in Cuba is more like us than you think, except worse."
t3_2gliyk,ckk9cif,"And while it's still a possible solution to the waste problem it's still a long ways away from becoming commercially successful. I do believe though that once it becomes a viable source of power that a lot of the nuclear scare crowd will disappear. As far as the second point, well that's a bit trickier and I don't have an open solution to this."
t3_2fwmff,ckdfg3r,"There are other factors to consider, such as the cause of the divorce. Before we get to that though, let's talk about the setting. The hypothetical situation I'd like to present will be a couple with two kids, with the husband earning 100% of the pay, and the wife staying home to raise the kids."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"I'm sure she would do some things, but for the sake of the example let's say it was negligible. Beyond that though, the ""violation of the contract"" was that she abandoned the family for another man, which went against her wedding vows which makes the divorce her fault. This should have some bearing on how the money is distributed, especially since she was unfaithful."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"That's why I brought up the drug abuse, because my understanding is that the mother by default gets primary custody unless there is something severely wrong that is well documented, and even then it's apparently a battle for the father of the children to get full custody. In hindsight though, maybe I should have left off any children in this scenario because it does make things a little more grey. The reason I brought them up in the first place was to 1) bring about a feeling of sympathy on your part for the husband, and 2) to steer you toward not being ok with the wife getting 50% of the family's resources."
t3_2fwmff,ckdgg9w,"However, you could base your decision more from a matter of what class the family was in. These days though, it's much harder to tell what class a person's background in, and even more difficult to tell their earning potential. A single will be able to benefit from free education or affirmative action programs to some degree so in that regard she may have more earnings potential after a divorce."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"I've heard of divorces where alimony and child support end up being higher than 100% of a man's income. Let's pretend the courts are fair though, and if the man abandons the house or is unfaithful, that usually does result in him being punished financially at minimum. I don't think it's a black or white thing, I think there should be discussions, plans for improvement, etc."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"Marriage is more of an emotional thing than a business decision. Actually, I'm not even sure if this applies in law, even though it seems fair, so I can't say that I agree or disagree. That's partially what I was going for, because I got the impression you felt no sympathy for men in these situations."
t3_2fu5da,ckd5eaz,"I think some of it may actually come from the way evolutionary scientists sometimes use the word. I've heard it used many times as a shorthand for any sort of behavioral plasticity, even though the people using it obviously understand that it's not conscious. "
t3_2fm9q9,ckb1reh,"You gotta make money somehow right? Even though it may have cost a dollar to make 2AA batteries, how bout we sell it for $4.35 eh? But lets pretend we don't know this though and put that aside."
t3_2fm9q9,ckb1reh,"Even though it may have cost a dollar to make 2AA batteries, how bout we sell it for $4.35 eh? But lets pretend we don't know this though and put that aside. Mac still isn't worth the price."
t3_2fkhgs,ckahr81,"Now look if someone doesn't understand me, it'll take me a second to realise it and say then fake it to sound a way they might understand - I have no problem with that. I'm not going to default to wrong pronunciations though. Also there are cases where I do default to the English version of the word - a consequence of being born in the US and only having received education in English."
t3_2fkhgs,ckab7k5,"However, when a Spanish speaker says eePod instead of iPod, this is disrespectful. Even though trying his best to respect its original pronunciation, but maintaining his typical accent when saying it. Because.. you know... the same way you can't say german words correctly, he can't say english words correctly."
t3_2fjsjb,cka49p5,"I think the Gibson in its application is also more versatile. Strats are seldom used for heavier, high gain metal sounds even though a lot of classic metal guitars seem to have strat like qualities (body design, neck thickness, etc.) The guitar just can't handle high gain as well as others, such as the Les Paul which I'd say is a top contender."

t3_2f8s0s,ck7aczu,"However, this is highly debatable. I won't go into all the reasons for and against (though I'll mention that poverty rates have stagnated after implementing our ""War on Poverty"", and they were drastically declining prior,) because they are all very complicated, and there are thoughtful voices on both sides of the debate. The point I want to make is that it isn't at all clear that the welfare state helps the poor."
t3_2f8s0s,ck7ja0r,Thanks for the comment. Not necessarily (though I do oftentimes lean towards that view.) One could make the argument that government-based police and military are necessary for the well-being of society.
t3_2f3w7f,ck68kw6,"If you don't want to give the State ""power"", then you don't have to apply for Marriage status, and you can just tell everyone you are married without having it be recognized by the state.

t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"stating things how religious beliefs would not cause a problem . But in 1917 there was a British conquest on Palestine which had many Zionist (Jews) volunteering to help the Brits in their mission but of course this didn't come without opposition, riots broke out in 1920 against the British rule and Jewish migration (though at this time the Jewish population was only around 10 percent, give or take). There were 2 more Aliyahs (migration of Jews into Palestine) between 1919-1929 and then finally in the 1930's the holocaust and Nazism caused a flux of a quarter million Jews to move into Palestine to escape the German ran genocide which caused another revolt in Palestine between 1936 to about 1939 and by the end of WWII, the Jewish population now accounted for about 1/3rd of the population in Palestine."

And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss .

This, according to Hobby Lobby, is an abortion, though I do argue with their reasoning behind that. If you look at it, getting pregnant in general can cause a spontaneous miscarriage, if they are trying to eliminate all the things that can cause a miscarriage, then they should just tell people to not get pregnant at all, because honestly every pregnancy could potentially result in a miscarriage."

t3_1kkvd3,cbqba5y,"Of course, what they pictured was perhaps further attacks on US bases in the mid east, or at worst, a repeat of the 1993 WTC bombing (which left 6 people dead). What happened, though, was that the terrorists came up with a plan that's brilliance was how amateur it was. Truthers act like there's no way these guys could have pulled something like that off, which strikes me as ludicrous, they believe that the government is capable of faking the whole thing in a giant, extremely convoluted plan, but the idea of breaking into an airplane cockpit with box cutters and taking control of a plane is implausible?"

I'm friends with a highly Christian person, and even though there are things we argue about, it's all based on opinion and we have had a wonderful friendship for almost 20 years. I am also in a relationship with a man who is atheist while I am agnostic (believe in god/heaven/just-live-kindly) and I far from think my SO will ever share the same beliefs as me, nor I him."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"I may be wrong but I'm fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent. I know I would be weary to hit a woman who hit me since I would perceive it as wrong, even though logically that makes no sense. This might not be about gender roles and just about justice porn (we even have a subreddit for it) which reddit loves like /u/BenIncognito points out, but you don't even have to agree with that."

t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But if I could afford a smartphone, I'd buy one, if I didn't already have a tablet (it was a gift). My mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) I gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But when she went back to our home country (splits her year between america and our home country because she has young grand children there), my brother didn't know how to use linux so he replaced it with windows for her. So the computer became a fucking mess even though all she does is read and watch news! Not to mention she hates windows because it's so difficult to use, and she misses linux :P Anyway, the computer becoming a mess is not a problem with an android/iphone, anyone who's used them once can use it anytime again in any other device."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"I mostly agree with you, but it's important to remember that ""human morality"" both contains rules/guidelines about what we can morally do (that is, what rights other beings have), and what we should do. Thus, even though I agree that animals don't have rights because we have no reason to restrict ourselves in our dealings with them, in certain cases it is still in our self-interest to not treat them poorly - not out of consideration for them, but out of consideration for ourselves. Specifically, though factory farming and such are fine even when they cause animal suffering, it is because the suffering isn't the goal but an undesirable yet acceptable side effect of the real goal, which is relatively inexpensive food."

t3_1kbeez,cbn9zoq,"I'm pleased that you make a distinction between mainstream pornography and any pornographic material, as most people I see arguing this don't seem to do so at all. I disagree that these are problems directly related to pornography, though. As far as the first two points, is this really something we can pin directly on this pornography, or is it more indicative of a general societal problem where men are valued above women, particularly in the realm of sexuality?"
t3_1kag5w,cbn17ww,"I don't think we have sufficient evidence to rule out either view, so the question becomes a matter of what kind of world you want to live in, and how these views influence how you live your life. The idea of determinism regarding consciousness is, I believe, based on the idea that people are seemingly given distinct choices, and that they seem to choose one path or another - though really, their choice was based entirely off of previous actions, and so is not really a choice at all. As an alternative model, perhaps it is possible that there aren't really choices in the way that we think of them."
t3_1ka1tu,cbmvpoo,Footage of gay pride parades is often used by conservatives to discredit the gay rights movement. Even though this position makes intuitive sense we can see that very public very unpopular (with the majority) demonstrations seem to work to move issues forward. The reason rants about sexist comics and gay pride parades work is because the absolute best thing you can do for a social justice movement is to expose it and give it attention.

Instead, they profile everybody based on demeanor and deviation from the norm."
t3_1it8ez,cb7ufo1,"It is more than likely that an anti-Israeli terrorist would be an Arab, but you can't lay down a similar hard and fast rule concerning an American criminal. We justify racial profiling by saying that a person with a specific characteristic is individually more likely to have committed a crime, though crime is not primarily committed by those with that characteristic. When you account for poverty, questionable laws (drug policy) and the fact that increased scrutiny of any group will uncover more crime, you're essentially enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy."

Someday we will probably see people's opinions of trans-people change (though it will probably change from them being treated as a joke -minstrel shows- to being treated with fear before they start to be accepted).

That particular disaster happened two years prior to our invasion of Iraq."

t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"For example if something in formal logic done by somebody who is both a mathematician and a philosopher, is useful in mathematics, that can hardly be said to be a result from philosophy used in mathematics, since for this purpose 'philosophical logic' and 'mathematical logic' are basically the same field. What you can say is that formal logic is useful in (the rest of) mathematics (though it is easy to overestimate this, centuries of mathematical discoveries were made just fine without any formal foundation, and even nowadays most mathematicians consider set theorists to be mostly irrelevant). I was thinking exactly the same, but the opposite."
t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"Often that debate revolves around the meaning of words.

t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"The NHS is another hot button issue honestly, every party leader in the UK will claim to be in favour of universal free healthcare because nobody in their right mind would want to antagonise the swathes of people who will turn on them if they dont. In practice though, it's a very different story, you just have to look at the last few governments record of subtle privatisation and reduced service. cutting foreign aid from £10B to £2B 

I'm really on the fence about this, my more extreme biases might come out here so i'll keep it brief."

Everyone laughed about the 20 year study that would require and the millions in litigation, and it was effectively not pursued, even though it was a much better alternative.

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"I think I can at least explain everything you've got a concern or problem with on the Holocaust front (I don't know enough about other genocides, etc to comment on those, to be honest), even if I don't quite end up changing your view. Hopefully I will, though. When I say that in the eyes of many Jewish people, the world has proven to us that it wants us dead, it's less about that being totally accurate and more about that it's a pretty natural reaction to finding out all the atrocities that have been committed against us."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"So adding the Holocaust to that can stir up some pretty sad and strong feelings about how people feel about Jews, and lots of us can't help but feel protective and like we are being targeted even today in areas that we are relatively safe in. I do think that even though we may be aware that the whole world doesn't actually want us dead, many of us are certainly afraid that someday, that sentiment will become popular (again-ish), and personally, I can't fault anyone for fearing that. Yeah, I don't think a conversation about freedom of speech has to include a long list of everyone in someone's Jewish family who died, but I do think if we're talking about the nastiness of Holocaust denial and anti-semitism (I hope you don't mind that I'm continuing to use that word - I prefer it over anti-Judaism because discrimination against Jews is at least partially due to our ethnicity, rather than our primary religion) it's relevant for a Jewish person to bring up their own history or experiences with it, even if it's not something that ""directly"" happened to them."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"People often resort to personal stories when discussing controversial subjects. Sometimes people do stick things in where they don't belong, though. But your view doesn't solely revolve around people bringing up these issues just in certain contexts, your view is that we have no right to be personally sensitive about it."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"Like, we stepped in and saved the Jews! But we never learned in my classes, for example, that the US turned away many, many Jews trying to escape the Holocaust, even though the immigration quota was nowhere near filled for most of the war. They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went. So even though the Holocaust is pretty ingrained, there's still a lot of pieces missing from the full puzzle of shared blame. And it's going to take Jewish people talking about that for quite some time before that's as ingrained as the rest of the information we learn about the Holocaust."
t3_32x0t2,cqfgq9p,I had to replace a couple of cards but they were still in warranty so no big deal.

Thats pretty much the only time a CPU or GPU has failed in my experience(if we are ignoring replacing fans).
t3_32qem9,cqdmrey,"So if you believe the politician should represent the views of the people, they would need to change their view if the people do. That doesn't really make sense though because many people are elected whose views are different than the majority of people they represent. It's common for an elected official to vote against the views of the majority of their constituents."

Because of this, the only timely equitable solution is for them to do the dishes when you cook."

t3_31iyzr,cq241hx,"Universities are expensive, above $50,000 for private universities and certain out state cost, but there are many state schools that provide quality education in $20-35,000 a year range some even under. Varies by state though. There are also numerous scholarships available from the universities and other groups to bring down the costs."
t3_31iyzr,cq241hx,"Also, the government allows you to set up a ""gift to minor account"" in which you can put in money tax free that can used to pay for their college. It reverts to their control at 21 though, so make sure they understand that the money is for school and using anything left over to get settled in a job. There is a lot of great educational opportunities in the US, you have to really look for them and weigh your options."
t3_31iyzr,cq241hx,"The religious right is political loud, but relatively absent from day to day life. Evolution is still taught, birth control is widely available, and if someone in your family really needs an abortion you can get it, though you might have to jump through hoops but the protesters are generally prevented from harassing patrons of clinics and most are peaceful.

t3_31extq,cq0zj18,"Because the republicans can cut taxes as much as they want, but the last thing to go will be the tax breaks and subsidies for corporations, and the first to go will be the things that most benefit the poor.

t3_2y1qef,cp5h19u,"The arguments against mandatory childhood vaccination can come from valid opinions that the government shouldn't force medical treatment onto someone who doesn't want it, even if it's for the good of society, but that's a subjective argument that just comes down to how you feel about the issue. Regarding the science, though, the evidence is crystal-clear. Yes, hygiene and clean water are hugely important, and that's why we continue to promote those as well, but there is very clear evidence supporting the idea that vaccinations cause dramatic differences in the rate of these diseases."
t3_2y1qef,cp5hsqg,"It's just a different place to draw the line. Well, as I said, it's a purely personal stance, but I'm pretty libertarian, so I take the side of no, the government should not be forcing people to do anything to themselves against their will, even though it's very clearly beneficial for society as a whole.

But, yes, immoral actions are immoral whether or not you know they are immoral."
t3_2wj2qe,corcu44,"Evo psych never claimed this either, mainly because natural selection is not a personified force, so it can not ""strive"". Natural selection does affect mating strategies though, because choosing the wrong partner lowers the chances of the offspring's survival.

t3_2vsa6d,cokgyrt,"Some families have rules like ""no politics at family gatherings"" and there's sometimes a taboo about discussing them in social situations, so I don't think what you're mentioning is unique to online posts - it's just that what we but online is broadcast, vs the direct face-to-face communication that is the norm. I think your argument that discussing politics is a lose-lose idea is poor in both cases, though - because the alternative to discussing them among friends is letting a conversation among media figures to take place of our own conversation.

Another approach, that is needed to have pertinent statistics, is to try to find the same informations though indirect means. For example if you know that last year 100 rapes happened and that 50 rapes were unreported (again getting this information is hard) and there was 60 rape accusations you know that 10 of them were false without knowing which ones."

It's bad because it's making a generalization about some group of people, and then applying, in words and actions, that generalization to members of the group as though there were some kind of causal relationship between statistical definitions of groups and individuals.
