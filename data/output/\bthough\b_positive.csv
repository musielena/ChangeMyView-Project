t3_2rnr30,cni3o83,"Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one? I don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. "
t3_2rmy6e,cnhc8a5,"A lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because it's been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that we're currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"You get to read arguments against other arguments and see how expert thinkers think. Obviously not, you need to study science (though you would be surprised how many leading scientists actively study philosophy). Science is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore the relationships between things in the world."
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"Say you're right, and most of the people who post here are incapable of actually changing their view on the subject they're bringing up (I don't believe this is the case most of the time, but just for the sake of argument). It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though. People have deltas awarded to them, and those signify that somewhere out there, somebodies mind was changed."
t3_2rexe3,cnf8xlt,"If business owners similarly extended military discounts too far, it could cut into their ability to be effective. On a personal level, though, I agree that ""military discount"" becoming ""public service discount"" wouldn't be a bad idea. It should be noted, however, that this would extend to even people like politicians, teachers, and government administrators"
t3_2r3fa4,cnc4l6o,"Essentially your argument is that our moral obligations stem entirely from our individual beliefs. Assuming you do not believe in hell (though maybe you do, I don't know) you are claiming that even though you don't believe this place exists, you think that someone who genuinely does believe such a place exists has the moral obligation to prevent people from being sent there - even though you would say that they are mistaken that there is such a place. So my response to that is this: if someone genuinely believed that a deity had told them to kill another person (or multiple people) in order for both they and he to achieve salvation, would you argue that it is moral for them to do so?"
t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"Or in other words, it would be condemned as homosexuality, becuase you cannot change the gender that God gave you. (You can't really actually change it with science, either, but don't say that to loud, people get threatened) The single biggest reason though, is that changing your gender is in effect spitting in the face of God. If he is all knowing, and all loving, you were made the way you were for a purpose."
t3_2qtorn,cn9ejzb,"We should not cater to it. I do a little volunteer work with a women's shelter (though I'm a guy), and you will probably find that those shelters offer services for men as well. The shelter I work with has a dedicated facility for women, and partners with hotels for men."
t3_2qrbaf,cn9b6ar,"And I tried. I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot. I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time."
t3_2qqxoy,cn8oez8,"As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us wouldn't describe them as ""delusional"" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries. While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself, and in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier."
t3_2qqa7z,cn8hti0,Every exercise I can think of can be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances . Eventually though you'll stop making strength gains and simply be increasing your endurance. This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.
t3_2qmhw7,cn7hxwe,"The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public. This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex. There's this mystique and taboos surrounding it's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7h4vg,"It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure. They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous. Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it."
t3_2qia6o,cn6rxow,"I would also hope that a start up's first technical hire could be someone the founders have a reason to trust. And I see a line manager growing his team as a microcosm of a founder growing his company, though the company may have rules in place to help keep the line managers from going off the reservation. Do your rules only apply to big companies?"
t3_2qb4ra,cn4kqwf,"It's like playing poker with players who never bet: it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog. That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design (even though it can be unfun in some scenarios); it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy. I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4h6d8,"Everyone has a mind that works in its own way. The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system. Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for ""dumb"" kids is the problem."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad. Still, though, Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre, and there's a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and much of the mainstream ilk out there. There have been classic Hip Hop and Rap artists awarded that kind of recognition for example URL And, you have brought up Kayne's awards and critical fame URL , which I think essentially negates your own point --- Hip Hip is getting credit, just maybe not in the way you think it deserves."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"Critical recognition is very different from public recognition, and Hip Hop has had a tough road in that respect, with a lot of negative publicity due to past gang violence, and now celebrity antics. No one, though, is arguing the worth of Hip Hop being less than any other musical genre out there, though. "
t3_2ppxgu,cmz3fxo,"4)With any circle-jerk you can assume there is a sizable portion of trolls within it. Even though they may be making fun of the ""CIS, white-penis'd, STEM wielding hivemind,"" some of them are probably those exact things. 5) While I don't have solid evidence of their ""downvote-brigading"" you have to imagine that it happens to at least a certain degree."
t3_2pnm9s,cmytc0t,"A majority of them of them were able to find employment and friendship after release. Those aren't the ones you hear about though. Odds are, in the last year, you have interacted with somebody working a job, who had previously spent over a decade in prison."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,"All of those things will happen. Why worry about it though? Why allow it to prevent having experiences like mine, or someone else, or something you dream up?"
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,We have total agency from an existential point of view although reality does assert itself early and often. We can still do things though. We can capture moments of experience.
t3_2pimzj,cmx2c61,"I was specifically looking for someone to shed light on a group that I have never been personally involved with, yet had strong opinions on, because I may want my daughter to get involved. CMV is a sub where there appears to be a more cordial attitude toward debate with less impassioned mud-slinging, derision, and name calling (though I admit I have only been viewing content for a couple of weeks). It seems that if someone really wanted to get on a soapbox, they could merely head to a sub that specifically handled their topic (politics, religion, etc.)"
t3_2p3z06,cmt7f8t,"For instance, per the CDC regarding Flu treatment: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm No, not everything can be treated, but going in and getting antibiotics may prevent you from getting pneumonia for instance. The two situations don't overlap completely, but, clearly employers think it's worth it, even though the more their health care is used, the greater their premiums. URL that's at least similar: Honestly, I can't think of a decent search term to pull up the appropriate study, but many cases of things like pneumonia patients think they might just have bronchitis or a cough, but if a doc listens to your lungs they can diagnose pneumonia."
t3_2ovqav,cmr1iii,"Everyone in the ground combat elements either knows or has seen someone like this. They buy pouches for their pouches, a dozen aftermarket accessories for their weapon that they don't even use properly and spray paint those accessories in earth tones even though they roll around in a giant fucking truck you can see from a mile away. They do their level best to look like a Call of Duty cover model and just end up looking like a douchebag."
t3_2ovqav,cmramno,"Think of it this way: you would think that rugby would be a much more dangerous sport than football because rugby players don't wear pads, but that isn't the case. The NFL is having problems with concussions and TBI even though they wear helmets and facemasks, rugby players the world over don't have the same problem wearing nothing more than a scrum cap. So what gives?"
t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"I read TFiOS, Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, and I thought that the hype was really unfounded because they were just more formulaic teen fiction. After revisiting the books later though to see why I had (briefly) originally liked them, I decided a lot of their appeal was because they deconstructed a lot of the tropes that they're made of. I'll concede that TFiOS is really overrated, but I think Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns in particular are really solid because they're a twist on the Manic Pixie Dream Girl thing that's really prolific in media right now."
t3_2okad4,cmo8ojn,"And it's not like Hazel ran around shouting it. She reminded herself that even though life seems unfair, she can still make the most of it. It might seem weird, but that little sentence from her favorite book helped her rationalize her cancer."
t3_2oihml,cmnhr07,"In the case where the person C is unaware of the relationship between A &amp; B I would agree. However, when person C is aware of a pre-existing relationship, even though he does not directly know person B and does not therefore have a meaningful connection to ""owe"" him anything, he is disrespecting person B by knowingly facilitating person A's breach of their social contract. Person C at that point has become an accessory to the infidelity, an accomplice if you will."
t3_2o6paa,cmkar1d,"OP, I'm going to make a bold jump here, but please bear with me. Based on your starting argument, It sounds as though you understand some of the basic principles of evolution, and that you have an idea of how the scientific method works, even if you aren't yet willing to accept the conclusion that all species on Earth descended from a common ancestor. My assumption here (and please, correct me if I'm wrong) is that you are not yet willing to accept common ancestry because it directly conflicts with a core belief that you hold, which is to say that you believe that all species on Earth came to exist exactly as they are, through creation."
t3_2nokg9,cmftzma,"The pacifist may have longer term goals than you. They may think that even though they can reduce next weeks major violence by committing minor violence today, they may be concerned about setting a precedent of violence that will last long into the future. They may believe that their example will pave the way for a dramatic and longer lasting reduction in violence years from now."
t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"So I would think by your logic we would have to acknowledge that your framework is also immoral. I don't though, because I reject the notion that imperfection implies immorality. I don't think that adequately sums up either of my second two points."
t3_2nbeuf,cmc4ns0,"You exist for some of those moments, then you die. Even though you die, your existence in those pages is untouchable. Nothing can erase that."
t3_2namx3,cmbzyjs,"If the police dash cam video shows you get out of the car, stumble around a bit, then puke all over the road, you're going to be convicted, no matter how good your lawyer is or how bad the prosecutor is. I can think of one example though where the issue you raise is very important. Basically anyone at the IRS or SEC who demonstrates substantial competence is immediately hired by some Wall Street law firm at 5 times their old salary."
t3_2n900k,cmbi11m,"I think the concept of going to start one's own nation is not analogous to changing jobs due to the amount of work required. Instead, the best option would be to change the system, since that is part of the ""contract"" I'm in with the government even though I never consented to it. A problem I have with your argument here is that it seems to assume that the policies of a government or company are stagnant."
t3_2n8psp,cmbnpay,"I have no problem sitting down discussing retirement plans together. Nor am I thinking about replacing any of them with a better model, as though women were all on some scale and I'm looking for the one with the highest number of girlfriend points. I just enjoy being with them, and hope to be with them for a very long time."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"I still can't bring myself to say that word without remembering those times. It went on for a while, I remember the last time though. Threatening to scream when his mum was downstairs, we were in his room and he'd locked the door."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"I took money from him not to tell my parents, or to let him do other things to me. It was great though, I could buy toys my parents didn't have the money to buy for me. I didn't know what prostitution was."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"After my second relationship I was older and more confident. I'd get drunk at any opportunity and have sex with pretty much any girl I could, paid for sex several times, it didn't really help though. I still felt dirty and feeling that way made me feel more like a woman than a man."
t3_2muo4y,cm8kfip,"As far as piracy vs. theft, I do think that the ease of getting away with it really does have a significant impact on the frequency of piracy. My main point though is that being part of society means putting up with a lot of legislation that you don't like and that, sometimes, upholding rule of law is more important than doing what you think you should be able to, for the sake of preventing people from breaking the laws you do agree with. Civil disobedience is what you do when you are so opposed to a law that you're willing to accept the penalty for breaking it, and risk others following your example of disregard for law, rather than follow it."
t3_2mesct,cm3nquu,"Yes, but the experience is personal and to what extent it is enjoyed subjective. Some people (even though they are a visibly smaller group) really just enjoy this initial buildup. - Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience."
t3_2m9le3,cm28iwd,"- ok, those parts were easy, they basically just say: follow a planner. They do not help with everything, though. Trying to manage several assignments at the same time, trying to make sure one is on time for meetings, etc."
t3_2lxha7,clz4fjz,"As the article says, I agree that it's difficult for parents to make decisions about their infant's future sex life. My parents had my brother circumcised even though their doctor told them it was medically unnecessary because they were worried that my brother would feel weird in later locker room and/or sexual situations when most of his peers would also be cut, statistically speaking. I think that in matters that will have an enormous effect on a person's self-esteem, social life, emotional life, etc., it is best to wait as long as possible to allow the child to have some say in their own future."
t3_2lwrsv,clzj8j6,"Discipline, initiative, physical fitness, and self-confidence are all pretty universal traits to success, and indeed, things that TRP/PUA advocate. So the military didn't strictly tell you to go talk to girls, what was so hard about figuring that out though? If you had asked your peers instead of going to the TRP, do you think you would have ever changed?"
t3_2lrnbm,clxhtmt,"After that if they chose not to make their work a bit legible then I wouldn't feel bad docking points off since you can't read anything. I can see the professor's point though, this is Engineering and not an English class. So he wants to grade on content rather than how pretty it looks which makes complete sense."
t3_2lqcby,clx99dx,"Speech is constitutionally protected no matter whether it's called public health or public safety or something else. The reason is that the first amendment protects the behavior, even though it's repulsive. Most cases of street harassment could not possibly be made criminal in accordance with current first amendment law."
t3_2lclza,clus7m4,"I'd argue none at all, but I don't expect to convince you if you disagree, and I don't expect you to convince me. Either way, though, the reality is that right now the overwhelming majority of meat (and other animal products, but let's focus on meat) is produced using obviously inhumane methods. To me, the only two surefire ways to ensure I don't consume any inhumane meat are 1."
t3_2kk7pc,clm4luc,"Financial exploitation has a vague definition, but if actual fraud has been committed, that's a more serious type of harm. Revenge porn with identifying information, though, could easily lead to life-threatening harm. Laws already exist to protect against this kind of stuff (and against similar activities like doxing) but the laws are scattered across many civil and criminal codes, which makes them unclear."
t3_2kgrtb,cll6vkk,"You have to think about what you're eating to make sure it passes the diet's rules, and if you consciously think about every single meal, you'll probably eat less. The actual rules don't really matter, though - you could make snacking harder by sticking to a ""diet"" in which you only eat foods that start with letters A-H. Counting calories and weighing everything you eat also requires that you think before you eat, but the burden is much higher than sticking to a few simple rules."
t3_2kfldi,clkve20,"The thing is that powerful followers of radical islam take great efforts to keep education away from people, so the two go hand-in-hand. Never said it wasn't, my point was that if you are going to go after the Bible for promoting violence, but give the Quran a pass, even though it has hundreds of verses promoting religious intolerance, then you are not being very philosophically consistent(not saying you are specifically, but there are plenty that do.). Many people who cry islamophobia have no issues with criticizing christians for their misdeeds, even though their actions towards people are lesser by comparison."

t3_2kfldi,clkve20,"Many people who cry islamophobia have no issues with criticizing christians for their misdeeds, even though their actions towards people are lesser by comparison. Female genital mutilation isn't a part of the Bible, though. That has more to do with local practices than it does with religion."
t3_2k19cr,clgz8mq,"I can in fact get all the nutrition required for healthy living without consuming products that cause animals to suffer, so I feel it is most moral for me to do so. In fact I still feel that what I wrote above holds even though I eat meat now (we're all flawed I guess). My first girlfriend was horribly allergic to soy, and lots of other things including chocolate."
t3_2k19cr,clgz8mq,She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so. If I were to try to enforce my beliefs about moral dieting on others (something I wouldn't do btw) it would have to be very conditional.
t3_2k16fy,clh464b,"Can you explain how do you have sexual orientation without gender? Is a couple with a m-f transgender and male partner gay, even though the man feels he is dating a women (but biologically male). Personally I feel as a society we put too much stock in this stuff (love whoever i don't care)."
t3_2jp9x4,cldt2z1,"Unfortunately for the back office, their work is never as highly valued as front office work. A front office can get by without a back office, though they will be less efficient. A back office has no purpose without a front office."
t3_2jp9x4,clekeze,"If a wife was a lawyer and the husband stayed at home and raised the kids you could easily imagine the wife saying ""I could simply hire a nanny for $X a month to do what you do - that is the free market value of your work and I bring 10 times as much value to our family through my work."" One of the interesting things though is that, generally, lawyers do not marry fork lift operators. Doctors do not marry call center reps, etc."
t3_2jkgzi,cld1es7,"But you know what? I discovered several new genes, one of which is important to the parasite's motility (and therefore infectivity), and discovered a key missing link in understanding the function of an already very well studied protein... didn't do any science though, according to you. Neither did Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick do any science when they got the structure of DNA."
t3_2jd1e2,clal24g,"Characters in ads now have cult followings like Mayhem, Flo, the old spice guy, and the most interesting man in the world. So even though you still have to sit through a bunch of ads during commercial breaks, the chances of one of those ads appealing to you are much higher because that sort of evolution was actually needed for advertisement to continue on TV. This brings me back to the original point."
t3_2jaiv1,cl9wvir,"Personally, I love the smell of marijuana, but that is probably due in some part to my previous use of it. One thing to note though is that as marijuana use becomes more socially acceptable and legally acceptable it will bring more innovative ways to ingest it that don't have the same smell of unburnt or burnt marijuana. Edibles and concentrates have been gaining popularity recently that don't have the typical marijuana smell, and vaporization has become a more popular way to smoke which doesn't carry the same smell either."
t3_2jaiv1,cl9wvir,Many legal growers and marijuana shop owners have essentially made marijuana their lifestyle. Do you what these people have done even though they make up the medical marijuana industry that you support? 
t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"So, I have nothing to say regarding your opinions - I agree that the U.S. military budget is way too high, and we could do well to implement a better health care system. One thing that's worth noting, though, is that having a military is not just as socialist as universal healthcare. Military necessarily needs to be provided for by the government, since everyone in a society benefits from having national defense yet nobody has an incentive to pay for it, so no private organization would ever be able to fill that niche."
t3_2j28la,cl81bji,"So while it'd be great if we had unlimited resources, we don't, and therefore it is a capitalistic good, and can be divided accordingly. Military defense is a fundamentally different type of public good though... "
t3_2j196u,cl7nh5y,"Note that this doesn't mean there are people out there that actually are trying to ensure that people are sexually assaulted; it just means that, out of ignorance or support of the status quo, we as a society end up reinforcing these norms and institutions, to our own detriment. It sounds to me as though you have a somewhat misinformed understanding about what feminists mean when they use the term ""rape culture"". Obviously, I can't speak for what everyone means when they use it, but let me at least try to broaden the scope of the term a little bit."
t3_2iwveo,cl6b8u3,"No one is going to feel the pain and whatever humanity would have died is already long gone. I would be against destroying the machine keeping the artificial brain alive though, because that's a thinking, conscious being, and that's akin to murder. So to me, it's being a conscious, thinking, aware being that gives you value."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r2er,"so ""good"" and ""bad"" have a different context here. ""Good"" is man functioning as though he would in a state of nature, and ""bad"" is any sort of deviation from that point. It is not a representation of the social view of morality."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"Also your hanging on Ron Paul as the libertarian of choice here, and he's not, hes a republican. ( i did support him, not because i believed 100% of what he said though, I had many disagreements with his platform, but it was the lesser of evils i suppose.) I mean more true to what republicans should be by definition of the word, as republican little ""r"" is a political philosophy and with a big ""R"" is a brand name fore a political party that is not republican or anything else other than lunacy, ""D""emocrats are also not really ""d""emocrats."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"It's not, it's not saying that socially their shouldn't be an outcry, but that unless rights are infringed, then legally there is not an issue. Certainly there is a social one though. Libertarians don't believe that there needs to be the state there using force to make racism bad... racism is bad because its fucking bad ( self evident when the arguments are made and over.)"
t3_2irrk7,cl4wdvv,"it isn't as relevant information if I say ""He's American, about 6 feet tall, big hands"" compared to ""He's Asian-American, about 6 feet tall"" etc. More importantly though, the idea won't have the effect you want. Let's imagine, for a moment, that you grew up in a time that didn't have a word for anything related to the male genitalia."
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"I'd rather reckon someone who who they are - isn't it nobler to accept them for that? Isn't it nobler to treat them equally, even though you are different? Isn't it more worthy an undertaking to transcend and go above racial concerns, rather than try to ignore that racial differences even exist?"
t3_2ilnf9,cl4i0sr,"(And unfortunately schools often only indirectly teach how to learn.) Yup, that's the delta, though I dunno if it works when you quote it as you did (maybe it does?). You're also supposed to include at least a brief explanation of why your view was changed (which I know you did in your other post, but for the bot to work it has to be in the same post)."
t3_2il5rb,cl3468o,"It wouldn't make sense to say that our problem is something that women need to resolve with their personal behavior. I don't blame Reddit for distracting me from my work, even though it's readily available. "
t3_2il5rb,cl38jy7,"I actually think an ideal society would permit individuals to go out naked for the sake of comfort, in most environments. I don't expect you to be convinced though, so in the spirit of a CMV, I'll try to convince you now. First, please examine these pictures."
t3_2ia3iy,cl0pza8,"Well, as long as you're sure. I know some people who got their jollies off of a huge courseload and multiple degrees, and never regretted it (though none went all the way to 4 degrees). A lot of business/econ/math majors felt this way."
t3_2i6wcg,ckzjivu,"There's media to propagate it as well. This is not the real world though. The older you get, the more shame you'll see dished out for someone getting drunk past being a little tipsy."
t3_2i6l9n,ckzcg4f,"It's a bit shortsighted to assume that just because they can possibly afford to this in the right now, that it's a sensible and practical decision for the long term. Many people have covered the idea that you can't judge someone else's finances, so I'm not going to go into that even though it is key here. There are two other points you seemingly haven't considered: What is the cost of having the mom stay home?"
t3_2i17u3,ckxvexx,"Sometimes, if you really love someone, you care for their happiness enough to know that you're not the person that will make them happy. You let them go, even though you love them, because their happiness is more important than your happiness. "
t3_2i0v1l,ckxu8a4,"To treat time as a valuable resource (""time is money"") is smart. But it doesn't seem like you're treating time as a valuable resource that you have to allocate carefully: you're acting as though you have unlimited amounts of time to squander on your professional goals. Imagine if you treated your money the same way you are treating your time."
t3_2hiuav,ckt28ag,"Windows 8 was clearly designed around tablets, which is fine , but what works for tablets for UI design doesn't translate to mouse and keyboard. Imagine using iOS or Android on your desktop, and tell me that Apple would benefit from switching from OSX to iOS for their operating system on a Mac Pro (even though you don't like Mac) Second EDIT: These two things are mutually inclusive; Windows 8 does not exist in a vacuum. You cannot say that Windows 8 is bad or good without comparison in any meaningful way, because if Windows 8 were the only operating system, it would be both the best and the worst operating system ever, quite literally."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrm2w9,"I think this puts the strategy involved in boxing as being at least comparable to that of American football. As an aside though, it seems that Football coaches are URL While the game might be strategic, if the coaches play an orthodox style, and ignore the subtle strategy, what good is the game having strategic depth in the first place? Chess has a ton of strategic depth, that doesn't mean that chess novices display any appreciable amount of strategy."
t3_2hcri1,ckrjgy3,"Could I get a delta for changing your view back again, then ? :p Because even though your edit is right, your initial view still makes a point.

Fancy meals come and go, expensive electronics break or become obsolete with the passage of time, college is important, but not worth giving up a sibling for, family though, and the impression they leave on you lasts forever and is important in shaping the adult that a kid will grow up to be.

It doesn't matter that Jessie did not personally hit Jamie with the rock, what does matter is that Jessie took advantage of Jamie when Jessie knew they were in a more coherent state of mind than Jamie was."

Like a lot of problems in Christian theology, though, it is usually dismissed by the faithful with some kind of appeal to faith - usually something like ""I believe in a good god, and part of my faith in God is the faith that what He does is Good and doing what he commands is therefore Good - to question his work would lack faith in his goodness."" Honestly, I think that is a kind of reasonable answer if you already have extreme faith, but is kind of a cop-out if you don't already have faith in God."

I would like to address what you say here though: This part is often untrue, and seems a bit pessimistic.

My point is fairly specific though; just because someone experienced truama in their family does not necessarily mean that it will be reflected in their own parenting style.

t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"Take Macklemore's win over Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys and on the charts: Kendrick is more technically proficient, more innovative, and offers a more complex emotional and political message. Crash won an Oscar over Brokeback Mountain (though it grossed significantly less) despite (or perhaps because of) heavy-handed, saccharine moralizing. A ""big message"" doesn't necessarily lead to superior art, and the idea that the biggest or most award-winning of a genre are also the best examples of that genre is demonstrably false."

t3_20madh,cg4ndzh,"Right now, one Japanese and two American astronauts, as well as three Russian cosmonauts are on board. Previously though, astronauts from Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa, South Korea and Spain have been on board. There are few international projects the scale of the ISS which can make similar boasts."

More importantly though, the argument can always be made that ""Programme X"" should be cut so that we can spend more on Education or Healthcare. The issue with this argument is that whilst it may be true, you will not only receive diminishing returns the more you spend, but there are often very good reasons that ""Programme X"" exists in the first place."
t3_20madh,cg4ndzh,"I've already shown some of the hidden economic benefits to space research, and the LHC undoubtedly has had some as well. Why though, does the success of one impact the other? Building ten LHC's instead of the ISS would not have discovered 10 particles, and nor would building another ISS instead of the LHC (and other similar projects) grant us much more."
t3_20krmr,cg48d5v,"These are the true dangerous chemical in cigarettes, the ones that cause your lungs to turn black and shrivel and die. The problem I have with the anti-smoking lobby is that they lumped all of it in together as one dangerous mess, and pure tobacco is a lot less dangerous than cigarettes (though there is still some tar, etc.). eCigs have some of these same chemicals, but the ones that remain are no different than the ones you find eating pre-packaged food or drinking soda."
t3_20evic,cg2s2cg,"You might find URL interesting, as it mentions the use of cigarette butts as currency in prisons.

t3_1zyxf5,cfykpyh,"During the Cuban missile crisis, the American military leadership believed wholeheartedly that the Russians/Cubans would not respond to a military invasion of Cuba with nuclear weapons. What they didn't know at the time (but found out after the Cold War) is that the Cubans, at least, were perfectly willing to use nuclear weapons even though the Soviets were not. In short, if states are rational actors and consider material factors, Waltz is right that more nukes means less war."

He refused medication for the first day or two, and we visited him every day."

t3_1yoc2s,cfmrnqs,"I would state that both (a) and (b) are true. (a), since there can be information reasonably inferred, though it isn't the most reliable of information.

Not every page can be a work of literary genius compact into itself, nor should it be."

t3_1yc8x2,cfjqxyk,"It doesn't require University to hold these views. I think you should dismiss these views because they're arrived at though needs that have to do with emotion and identity and belonging, not function or experience or deliberate, focused study. In the Western world it is very political, so just having a point-of-view and choosing a side, regardless (and often in spite of) the reality is valued."
t3_1y8r7h,cfibmko,"No reasonable person would say otherwise. What I think you are getting at though, is when people judge others based on a lack of information that lead up to some marginal action. Rape and murder is objectively bad-at least most would agree-stealing a loaf of bread is simply something that can be forgiven depending on what caused a person to steal."
t3_1y8e6p,cfidj9k,"So do Mark Rothko's works. Even though many people (including myself) dislike this genre of art (personally I find it to be low effort), it's not like you can say that it doesn't fit the definition of art. Now as for all of this style of art being terrible, I think that's a very close-minded generalization."
t3_1y5jpe,cfhjc63,"How about someone who, say, brutally raped a dozen prepubescent girls, causing massive irreparable internal damage, and left them beaten and broken?

t3_1y0z80,cfggmp9,"We tried this out here in Montana a while back, where the speed limit on Interstate Highways was set to ""Reasonable and Prudent."" This changed a few years later, and we now have very specific speed limits, though it still took a few years before we had a state-wide prohibition on driving with an open container of alcohol. The problem is that people tend to over-estimate the capabilities of their vehicles, as well as their driving skills."
t3_1xwomv,cffjyds,"Instead, they draw you in by talking about general sociological theory without really going into detail about how it's applied or what it accomplishes. Remember also that every scientific field begins with personal opinion and conjecture; it's only upon performing the boring studies and such that it become Science with a capital S. Our understanding of gravity started when Newton (anecdotally, though not actually) had an apple fall on his head and thought ""something made that apple fall"", leading to ""I wonder if there is a force that attracts things to each other"", leading to scientific research to verify this conjecture, and now several hundred years later, we have a very refined understanding of the gravitational force. To draw a parallel to your original example, I don't think it's hard to argue that it's common sense that if you drop something it will fall."

t3_1xti2t,cfepy2q,"Yes, I think it is more about viewership and interest. A few years ago though there was a MLB player who did rant about the treatment of Black-Americans compared to Black-Hispanics, so I can't speak about what's going on within the organization itself and how Black-American players feel or are being treated. But as a young Black-American I don't hear young Blacks complaining about baseball--- they don't watch it to complain about it."
t3_1xrors,cfe2r8p,"There is nothing wishy-washy about it. Unfortunately though, decimal numbers are not unique, since the infinite sum 9/10+9/100+9/1000...=1. That means 0.9999... = 1."
t3_1xqnjx,cfdsxp9,"The other thing you have to remember about teaching in college is that college students are supposed to be more independent in their studies than in grade school, meaning that if they want to use their laptops/tablets and distract themselves by going on the internet instead of listening during class then they will ultimately face the consequences with a worse grade. Also, you might have noticed that I excluded the use of cellphones in this because in my experience students don't necessarily use cellphones for educational purposes in class but rather to distract themselves (even though they can be used for almost anything a tablet can be used for).

t3_1xqloo,cfduxm3,"Down your line of thinking insanity lies where you can never really be sure of anything and you are constantly clouded with doubt. I've gotta say though I think I've just achieved a wall of text here, I totally agree in pretty much every way with your statement beyond the absolutist position of NEVER hold a belief so firm that your mind cannot be changed. I think maybe it's true of roles, a judge or doctor or politician should never rules something out completely or hold any opinions with 100% conviction, but us as simple individuals, we probably need at our core a few unshakable facts about reality that we never question because possibly that way madness lies?"
t3_1xqbkw,cfdnoww,"You feel like a normal, two-armed person in every way, but you have this third arm flopping around constantly reminding you that you're different. This might naturally cause you a lot of distress since people are going to treat you differently, even though you're just like them on the inside. You talk to someone about getting it removed, and they laugh and explain that it's just how you were born and you're silly for thinking you should only have two arms."
t3_1xny71,cfd4qsf,"No openly gay characters, episodes like the one where they introduce the Trill or where they had the gender neutral people (both TNG) were supposed to be allegories for gay people but the episodes were neutered (for instance by casting all the neutral people with women so Riker wouldn't kiss a man). Even the first lesbian kiss they overtly insisted that it was really a former man and a former woman kissing and not two women even though physically it was two women. Why do I bring this all up?"

t3_1x3quk,cf82a08,"They're placed on reddit, and upvoted by redditors, specifically because the posters and voters thought, in their heart of hearts, despite what polite society would have us think, that they could bring joy to a whole lot of people by sharing a simple photo with others. Thus, that picture of a girl's ass filling up most of your front page as you scroll down the page is representative of what makes reddit a beautiful, magical place: that things are shared out of kindness and upvoted with goodwill, and even though we may not agree with everyone on the site, even though we might despise a lot of the content, we know that we're mostly just decent people who are looking to enjoy ourselves for a little while on the internet, and we're not going to spoil some arbitrary rules about what is acceptable in polite company ruin our good time. If the unfortunate side-effect is that you have to occasionally see some naked pictures because you don't want to stick to your front page rather than /r/all AND you don't want to turn of NSFW posts then, well, maybe its something you should just let go."

t3_1wi4dg,cf3apv9,"Usually those types of people don't get much attention, at least compared to groups like the Westboro Baptist Church, but I believe that many people are like that. Paula Deen was plenty nice to African-Americans even though she was secretly a massive racist the entire time.

t3_1we3gg,cf15san,"The condition's heritability is 50%. It doesn't present the same in everyone, though everyone has the same mutation. Some people are mildly hindered, but it can also be fatal on it own, and it increases risk for cancer."

The issue though, is that this is a many layered process, which first starts with, what is the rate of transmission of the gene.

t3_1we3gg,cf14k7c,"On the other hand, other genes increase the chance of heart attacks, or strokes, or skin cancer. Even though I have been fortunate enough to never have had cancer, you might have a statistically better genetic profile than I do.

This could be a derivative of the self-defense required when being tread upon by every other segment of society, though I'm not certain when it comes to this.

When you think about the specific situations in which many couples find themselves, though, those arguments become clear. The cost issue brings up a very simple situation: many good health insurance plans cover IVF the same as any other medical issue."
t3_1vrpkb,cev6nad,"For some people insurance is a bad decision at any price. But I believe the fact that most people buy insurance means that they have though about it, measured their risk, expected value, and aversion to that risk and decided that it makes sense to pay for that kind of insurance.

If you do not want any sort of protection of this status, however, then in what way will this land remain free and stateless?"
t3_1vg6qn,cerydvt,"So from what I can gather from your OP, the only reason you actually think this is a good idea is because it will increase the total GDP. There's a big problem with this though, ignoring ""muh freedoms"" which is a fairly obvious argument: You can't assume that every business will actually benefit from this, because you are not properly comparing profits in the current system vs. profits under your new one.

Secondly, if you honestly believe that if your children do NOT accept Jesus Christ as their lord and savior (to take a religious example, as I'm fairly certain that's the general problem you're having), they will be sent to an everlasting, painful, torturous hell... can you possibly say it is anything but evil for you NOT to teach them, even force them to accept Jesus Christ?"

This will make things get steadily more expensive over time - which if you think about it you've probably seen in your lifetime (lately though the trend hasn't been to raise the amount on the price tag of basic goods, but to sell a smaller amount for the same price).

Women can certainly still get pregnant, though even in the Navy it was more than a little bit recommended they choose to get an IUD to avoid this as it can, indeed, be a deep complication to their personal as well as their unit's readiness.

By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?). It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised."

t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"So the secularism of a state is in no way linked to the kinds of laws they make regarding religious freedoms (the UK and Iran are not secular states that take vastly different approaches to religious freedoms). Second, the United States is famously a secular state but it is rife with religious justification for laws (though, not regarding the right to worship). It is also institutionally Christian - the US president swears an oath on the Bible, the pledge of allegiance cites union under God and the national motto is ""In God We Trust""."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"In spite of this and it's overwhelmingly Christian population, the US has yet to bar worship of any religion. So far we see that while a given state may be officially or unofficially secular, this has no bearing on a) it's capacity or willingness to accept religious argument as a basis for legislation and b) just because a state legislates in line with a particular religion's belief's doesn't mean that it will begin to encroach on the right to worship - though the rights of non worshipers suffer, discussed below.

For example, to put it simplistically if you are analyzing states from a realist perspective you would primarily be looking at conflict/war and, (though feminist literature shows how women have participated and been affected by war) as historically men have done the fighting this theory really only analyses men's behavior in conflict completely ignoring women's behavior and perspective.

t3_305ejo,cppptb8,"And so they're trying very hard to understand this new interaction, trying to build patterns with stereotypes, or maybe trying to apply this new interaction everywhere (like you and your friend). Overall, even though I don't like it at all, this reaction from society seems pretty logical, I'd say give it time, the novelty will fade eventually and it will get better. "
t3_304ub4,cpp5eqv,"While I acknowledge that we already do this in many places (healthcare included, for example), this does NOT mean that those laws are just or right, or that these similar situations are completely the same. For instance, I feel much better about contributing to the health insurance of someone who's mother drank while pregnant - even though as a community we are paying for someone else's mistake, the stakes are higher, and I would prefer that the person be able to live a healthy life. Furthermore, if a driver is looking for advanced protections from bad/aggressive drivers, why is it up to the government, and not the driver themselves, to provide the means to do so?"

t3_301n6h,cpolqex,"What matters is if you're involved with your tribe and if you're part of the community. This varies tribe to tribe, but for a lot of Indians^2 community involvement matters way more than blood quantum (though blood quantum still matters, again, depending on the tribe.) Spending a year on a rez is better than nothing, but it could easily have been for one of those feel-good mission trips."
t3_300pmw,cpo5gbr,"That being said I have been propositioned by both men and women. I can only think of one occasion where a man has propositioned me and he was definitely persistent; though that may have been because I was not clear enough or he was too drunk to realize.

t3_30059g,cpo9jne,"Pet fur sheds ubiquitously anywhere the dog goes, in shedding breeds -- there are seasons where it's elevated for certain dogs, but this cannot be predicted and shedding never stops, just slows. Non-shedding breeds still can trigger allergies by leaving saliva on surfaces (although the risk doesn't last for long, if I had to guess, though an allergist would have to pipe up on that one), and anyway, shedding dogs are much more common than non-shedding breeds or crosses. Individuals who are sensitive to pet dander can be astoundingly sensitive to small amounts in the environment, and sometimes their reactions can be very serious."
t3_2zxz9r,cpnemdd,"I do want to begin by saying I don't have much Bulgaria-specific information. If it's ok with you, I'd like to assume some of the findings are somewhat generalizable though. First, it may be the case that the average voter isn't actually all that ignorant."
t3_2zxa1c,cpn5f5x,"We can see this throughout history, like how in Greece and Rome landowners were themselves soldiers, and Kings personally led armies into war, or how the aristocracies in countries like Britain and France were expected to care for their workers and those who lived under them in order to be respected as part of the nobility. In the modern world this cultural sense of noblesse oblige has been somewhat lost with the aristocracy, though you are well aware that those who are rich and powerful (money is power) and at the same time hugely generous (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet) do gain respect and gratitude from both the masses (their underlings) and their fellow ""nobility"" (other rich people). So no, no one can make you do anything with your money, but you can be pressured, and people can judge you, and perhaps it's actually your obligation to be a magnanimous leader, as your power in society gives you a leadership role in that society."

t3_2zow2m,cpl22pp,"What the fuck, right? I got everything I wanted: I had a girlfriend (who was a virgin, though for me this wasn't that important) who wanted to spend lots and lots of time with me, who was extremely cute and talented and geeky (she had more anime and manga than most retailers), who loved me (we said it to each other the night we had sex) and only me. I made it, I won."
t3_2zow2m,cpl22pp,"Being in a relationship won't save you from feeling bad and, in fact, may even make you feel worse than if you had stayed single. It will not fix long term feelings of inadequacy or emptiness--though, yes, in the short term it can, this is simply not sustainable; those feelings will just creep back with slightly different language much like a cold virus mutated just enough to fool your antibodies. This is because, as I learned, this is not what relationships are for, it is not what they do, and it is not how they work."
t3_2zow2m,cpl22pp,"But don't expect it to hammer nails. So, getting literal, having a relationship can be great (though, as my story tells, this is not a guarantee), but you cannot expect it to fix all the other problems in your life. If you do, you will be disappointed."

t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"You can make any of these five excuses, or maybe a lot more, but you can't say it's unreasonable for the hosts to think they should integrate, because it's not unreasonable to assume that immigrants have some serious reason for preferring the host country, that overall a large net influx of immigrants suggests the host country is systematically more successful in a way that the immigrants themselves appreciate, and that cultural differences do explain some differences between some countries. And if those are reasonable things to think, then even though you don't have to agree with them, you certainly have to admit that there's nothing wrong with expecting immigrants to integrate, and that that expectation can be motivated by something other than racism. Even if it a native actually believed that all of the cultural differences between him and the potential immigrants were trivial and purely cosmetic , there is nothing wrong with having preferences between cultures."
t3_2y2tk3,cp5tac5,"And the protests actually distract attention from someone doing something like that (something that's both informed and productive)... it's the signal lost in the noise surrounding larger, uninformed and largely unproductive protests. People use the Ferguson riots (which weren't about general issues of race but were instead mounted as though they were about a single white police officer wrongfully killing an unarmed black man who was trying to surrender) as the basis to judge the entire ongoing civil rights discussion America needs to be having. It turns out that, as many have said from the beginning, Officer Wilson didn't murder a black kid for shits and giggles."

t3_2y1nt3,cp5nc7k,"That's exactly my point. You want to learn a store of background knowledge (like the organization of your operating system) by heart, because even though you could learn the answer to any specific question with a search engine, even fairly basic investigations are complex, unwieldy, and unreliable until you have enough background knowledge to streamline the search down to the more challenging questions.

t3_2x854p,coxwtm2,"And again, the lyrics for ""All Falls Down"" touch on ideas and sentiments that were not only contrary to what the usual sentiment was for mainstream artists, but a sentiment that Kanye believes (and perhaps rightly so) pervades black culture- the unhealthy obsession with materialism. In each verse, Kanye shows how damaging this obsession is, from the woman naming her daughter Alexis or a Lexus (""She couldn't afford a car/so she named her daughter Alexis""), to ""It seems we livin' the American Dream/but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem/the prettiest people do the ugliest things/for the road to riches and diamond rings"" (both an indictment of celebrity culture, and the people who emulate it), and ""we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom/we buy a lot of clothes though we don't really need 'em/things to cover up what's inside/cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth"" another assessment of culture and Kanye's experience as a black person in America (really most people's experience) of being repeatedly told by the media that we should aspire to become more thin, wear better clothes, etc. instead of work on our inner selves."
t3_2x854p,coxwtm2,"Finally, ""Blood on the Leaves"" is an incredibly powerful song, not only because of the classic Nina Simone sample from ""Strange Fruit"", a song about black people being hanged due to racism in the south, but also because of Kanye's attempt to highlight racism that still pervades American culture. ""All I want is what I can't buy now"" addresses Kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""All Falls Down"" ""We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom""). The entire fourth verse could be a darker repurposing of the ideas in ""All Falls Down"" where he laments all the struggles he still endures as a black man today despite his success like constantly being told no when he wants to buys lavish things like Benzes, cocaine, etc."
t3_2x854p,coxtndh,"This was the context that ""All Falls Down,"" was released. In ""All Falls Down"" he talks about how, even though he realizes the futility of consumerism, he is completely addicted to it. He readily admits that his entire persona is a front for his own fragile ego."
t3_2wt9ya,cotyuzj,Similarly they might be forever in a gray area. They're cultural debates though and not universal morality. Not the topic at hand.
t3_2wt9ya,cotyuzj,"Similarly to how humans wouldn't have researched the ansibles, Formics had no reason to research morality (without individualism there would be no need to evaluate the value of an individual).

Overall you conflate social norms, laws, and moral debate with morality."

I would ask, though, for you to explain better why you think that both the impracticality doesn't matter, and why you find it offensive? If an actor can bring someone disabled to life on the screen and give a really faithful and convincing performance with due respect given to the disabilities that person has, what is there to be offended by who portrays that character?"
