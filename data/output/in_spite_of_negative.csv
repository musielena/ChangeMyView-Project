t3_2lvano,clyhfb1,"Now (and I admit this is subjective), I'd consider a letter that has uneven spacing to be less neat than a letter where perfect columns are maintained throughout and hyphens are used to complete words exceeding the available column space. It does sometimes create a mental pause when read, but it still often looks more professional and more coherent than an item where words are squeezed into tight margins or written out fully in spite of the margins. "
t3_29n4wo,cimnztj,"That being said, I'm not sure if you're trying to justify never pursuing a relationship or if you're just trying to say that your methods are morally fine. If it's the latter then I can say as long as you don't feel entitled to a relationship in spite of your methods (and you don't seem that way) then it's fine by my book, but in all actuality your morals are the only ones that matter so who really gives a fuck what anyone here thinks? If it's the former I'd say that everyone definitely should be on-point and ready to pursue the man, woman, or whatever of their dreams because you'll get greater satisfaction out of it."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"Since others have already (in great detail) explained what depression really is: a disease. A complicated condition involving malfunction of the neurotransmitters in the brain...of lack of or inability to produce or receive vital chemicals...etc - I will instead explain why your friends act the way they do, because of as well as in spite of their depression. One thing that must be noted is that your view point is far from unique."
t3_25e9jx,chge47o,"Belle tried to escape from the Beast, and even afterwards, never put up with him acting violent or hostile. The whole story was about the Beast learning to change and be a good person who is worthy of Belle, and then Belle fell in love with him, not about Belle tolerating his hostile attitude yet falling in love with him in spite of it because ""he has a good side hidden deep inside"". The first act was clearly take place during Fall judging by the leaves, there was a snowball fight in the middle, and a spring cleanup, then the villagers' march in a rain."

What would most likely happen is that people would continue to have children in spite of the financial repercussions. They would then be unable to support their families adequately, and would rely on government assistance."

t3_1wteqq,cf57as7,"--- The core issue for things like Gay Pride is that it's a counter to the notion that gay people should be ashamed for being gay. Pride is defined as People who are gay for example, can rightfully be proud of what they've achieved in spite of the opposition to them that exists in our institutions, our culture, even our language. It creates a sense of community and solidarity for those in the group."
t3_1q4sao,cd98dtc,"I'm glad that you like the way I think but, Your view is that ""I believe that celebrities that complain about their life being bad are full of shit."" My post described how they're not full of shit and that, in spite of being rich, their complaints have merit and they do have real problems regarding harassment and mental anguish and we shouldn't deprive them of rights that everyone else has or criticize them for wanting rights that everyone else has. Does this help change your view?"
t3_1bc8lk,c95k5tq,"Certainly, there's lots of evidence to support your view. Men like Abraham Lincoln almost certainly suffered from depression and they went on to do great things in spite of that. My question to you, I guess, is, what does that have to do with it being a 'real' illness?"
t3_2zwjql,cpmyrsa,"I can't help it. Depression is feeling like this in spite of one's situation - I have no reason to feel this way, yet I do. That isn't something somebody can just completely change with a bit of effort."
