t3_2qrbaf,cn9b6ar,"I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time. And I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games, because these are things I want to know but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore. I love that the extended edition helped with this, especially in this situation, because most of the answers to that on the internet before were ""If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!"""
t3_2phwfa,cmwy98c,"Because it seems to me like there is a consensus on this. I mean, there is already a Surgeon General warning on cigarettes, so that's probably an area that, despite killing a lot of people, there is not much more the SG can do to promote awareness. Something like vaccinations or gun control have many people on both sides of the issue."
t3_2ouj9f,cmqnhg8,"Using the same reasoning, how can you judge someone who has attended mathematics courses outside of school several years more advanced than current study on the same level that someone who doesn't? Additionally there are people who have mental deficiencies that inhibit their ability to do mathematics and they are also required to take mathematics (at least 3.0 credits if I'm not mistaken) in high school despite the fact that they will likely not continue in this field. "
t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"If she were wearing rags I guarantee the comments would be more critical. What people see in this picture is a woman who is dissatisfied with her image, despite trying the best with what she has. Criticism won't get her much farther."
t3_2nzufr,cmil7ck,"This could be considered a dysfunction- this was a fairly recent mutation that occurred because we generally don't to synthesize vitamin C for survival. But there's no social norm attached to this, and no reason it should bother us, despite the fact that we could call it a dysfunction. "
t3_2namx3,cmbyg7r,The bad lawyer can screw things up even if the facts and law are on your side. It's much harder for the good lawyer to win despite really being wrong. 
t3_2namx3,cmbzyjs,"This creates a massive imbalance of talent in any lawsuit brought by one of the agencies. And since those cases tend to involve very complex financial or accounting laws, the hedge fund might win despite having done the financial equivalent of stumbling out of the car and puking on the road. "
t3_2n8psp,cmbfe4h,"Easy, I want my partner to be happy. Now, despite the fact that I'm totally awesome at sex and romance (jk), I'm totally aware that sleeping with other guys will make my partner happier. So why shouldn't I be ok with an open relationship?"
t3_2lxha7,clz6dii,"Many doctors all over the world have assumed this same thing about people with intersex variations like mine, forcing them into unnecessary surgeries that have caused a LOT of problems. I escaped the surgery, and despite the fact that I am straight, I have not needed the surgery at all. It was completely unnecessary and cosmetic, much like the surgeries that are happening on other intersex kids."
t3_2le6r2,cltxkan,"Everyone must be judged as being 100% truly guilty to receive a punishment. The idea works in theory, in your head, but in reality it will never be possible because we will end up torturing innocent people, just like we end up sending them to prison or death row despite believing they're guilty. "
t3_2k1puo,cli979e,"Now, I'm going to flip it around on you for a second. URL obesity, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, gout, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, multiple sclerosis, and (believe it or not, despite refraining from dairy) osteoporosis. In a post-apocalyptic world where physical fitness will presumably be of immense survival value, explain how we're at a disadvantage?"
t3_2jk5tw,clciqy4,"Whether or not these companies succeed at duplicating these tastes is besides the point, the point is that there will be companies who are trying to directly target the kinds of people I was describing. Because, face it, the majority of people (you and I included) are not vegetarians or vegans, despite probably knowing it is better for our health, the environment's health, and nicer to animals. But as I said at the beginning, all vegetarian/vegan companies are not only making pseudo-replicates of food."
t3_2ixmih,cl6thrq,"On the other side of the coin, there are URL . This despite the fact that most people don't want to interact with the cops. So in any given interaction between an average person and a cop, we are more than nearly three times more likely to be killed than they are, yet we are supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt because of the fear they feel?"
t3_2iovvi,cl43i7i,"It helped me get through a very stressful and upsetting time in my life. I was in counseling, and doing my best to get through my life despite the emotional rollercoaster that had become my life. One day I was upset about something and I had the overwhelming urge to go home and cut."
t3_2ho91q,ckui99j,"Logically, person B should always accept the money, even if it was very small. Why would person B cut off their nose despite their face? To try to give a hint to person A that their behavior was not altruistic, selfish, and even insulting."
t3_2gydya,cknrbir,"I used to be just like you. Gay, completely cognizant of the fact for a decade or so, and despite a couple of attempts at having relationships (once with each gender), determined to spend my life alone, never having physical or emotional intimacy, never falling in love. And then I met this person who changed my life forever, and doesn't even know it."
t3_2giql7,ckm2t5e,"Also a lot of people conflate ""Loving yourself"" with some bullshit ideas of fooling themselves that they love themselves, but not really. My whole point of the above paragraph is, say you do find a great guy and he likes you despite of everything, don't let your life be dictated by him because you believe that you can never find anyone else who will like you despite of your body. This will make anyone get turn off."
t3_2ggppl,ckixuwj,"Also, recognize that the 25 Mbps is the maximum in the so-called ""last-mile"" and says nothing about the rest of your ISP's network, or its connections to other networks. Netflix ran into this problem with Verizon recently, where Verizon's internal network was fast, but they refused to add additional links to the connection between Verizon and Netflix (despite all the demand from Verizon customers for such a connection). As a result, a bottleneck was created."
t3_2g3olf,ckfcgxf,"and as such the one we should use. As for accuracy, you may be right: ISIS implies Syria, which seems to be the product of a mistranslation and should therefore be avoided, despite our URL URL URL URL of URL URL URL . But as for usefulness, ISIS is a much more useful acronym than ISIL, at least for English speakers, since the former is more easily spoken in English than the latter."
t3_2fu5da,ckd2dqa,"A parent can make many choices for their kid beyond what the law proscribes, and even into adulthood, family acceptance in general can have significant impact on happiness. Many parents have accepted their children's homosexuallity despite a religious background that tells them not to, because they believe that it's not just some sinful choice on the part of their child. Were the argument only ever about the right people should have to love whom they please, this wouldn't be enough for parents to turn their backs on biblical teachings."
t3_2fgw85,ck96vg6,"My personal recovery took a while and hell, like I mentioned earlier, I still get aftershocks once in a while. All I can tell you is that depression isn't all there is to your life despite its prominence right now. I'm sorry."
t3_2f48co,ck5siun,"But honestly I think you must first examine why you hold these beliefs, and whether you have good reason to think as such or not. This is a very unusual conspiracy theory to hold (and despite your proclamation to the contrary, it is most definitely a conspiracy theory) because Hollywood has traditionally been accused of being full of hard-left communists, something that generally runs counter to your claims. I must admit I don't see any easy way to convince you that you're wrong, because it's not really clear why you believe this stuff."
t3_2dsd7q,cjsmz7i,"But this would be abstracting the whole conflict into a 2-dimensional black/white debate. For many reasons, this is not a good approach for objectivity, despite how each side is portrayed. Here's one perspective on why Hamas won in Gaza in 2006: http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/02/07/why-hamas-won/ This is an extremely good read, and prophetic in describing the situation today."
t3_2digbr,cjpsxny,"And that's exactly what happened to us long ago when we didn't use these things. Of course, you can point out all the animals out there that are fine, but obviously you're only pointing out the animals that are alive and well and that have survived despite all the risks in their lives. People are not okay with needless deaths so they will do simple things to prevent it."
t3_2c8wp9,cjd37hj,"There is a reason Israel is being accused of willfully violating international law by the UN. The Israeli's will drop leaflets to evacuate target areas, the civilians evacuate to centers designated safe-zones, and then the Israeli's proceed to shell these designated safe zones anyway, despite numerous attempts to give precise GPS coordinates of these locations . "
t3_2c0frm,cjb1sid,"I stand beside my gay brothers not as a gay man but as an atheist who believes that religion should not be any reason to persecute someone, in either direction. I am a feminist despite having a penis because I believe all humans are equal, rather than subscribing to the religious notion that women are designed to be subservient to men. I am an atheist because women deserve freedom, and gay people should be free to love who they please."
t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"People often are cold/distant with each other at first and then open up as time goes on and they come to know and trust and see the emotional welcoming warmth of the other person, they come to see the other person as another person, not a stranger. Maybe the warped view of relationships that the media presents as so irrationally necessary despite there not being great reasons to enter them has to do at least partially with the fact that the media by and large only really presents monogamy as the main viable option and with the importance of intimacy to the human animal, most human animals find themselves in a somewhat desperate situation to both fulfill their need for companionship and sexual release, but also stay within the bounds and confines of the standard social norms. Now with all this said - humans should be free to choose, without social duress, what actually suits them best."
t3_29koa9,cim0cmu,"This is not the case in soccer. For example, a team which is multiple divisions below another team (say Plymouth Argyle Vs. Man Utd) could meet in the cup, and despite Man Utd controlling the game for 90 minutes, a Plymouth Argyle 91st minute counter attack could turn the game from extra time and a probable Utd win, into a memorable victory for the minnows, something which is possible, but much less likely in other sports (including american football) due to how hard it is to prevent any team from scoring points. This type of fast paced excitement is partly what makes soccer the favoured sport of most of the world."
t3_28a5fu,ci9bvft,"But the actual emotion is not. Behaviour reveals what you truly value or don't value - despite the words you say or think. So if behaviour contradicts words, then your words are a contradiction (either a lie, self-deception, or erroneous)."
t3_281xh4,ci6kx4e,"You seem to have this idea that we are a nation of Ubermensch, when a cursory glance at the Olympics and other world competition would tell you otherwise. We often lose in basketball despite having most of the best players. We lose all the time in hockey."
t3_27p2fu,ci302xh,"Still, he's clearly a competent guy, it's really not fair to blame him, let alone all of Gotham. Another sign of how kind hearted and principled the people of Gotham are, despite this plague of supervillains they refuse to pass the death penalty. In fact, there are times where they actually accept the Joker's or Two Face's insanity pleas, which surely wouldn't fly in U.S. courts."
t3_27gvea,ci0ojb6,"4. Speeding vehicle charging a manned checkpoint, ignoring multiple warnings and crossing the 100m ""Dead Zone"" despite flares, flags, signage, and ""dazzlers"" and as a result, crew-served weapons were used to take out the tires and driver to prevent a massive VBIED (car bomb) from taking out the road and everyone on it a'la Beirut. "
t3_27aa6m,chyw1lz,"They will want to work in their field and contribute to it. It's more likely that after a successful career in their field, they might want to run for congress, but now they are too old despite having accrued considerable life experience. 4."
t3_277x8k,chyttqk,"Beyond a point you are right. If I was making $25,000 as a video game tester and moved to a job at $70K as a garbage man - I would probably be happier despite one job being more interesting. After reaching a level of comfort, which depending on geography is often around $70K, extra money is great but loving your work is as well."
t3_25pnxw,chjirvh,"So, there doesn't have to be a real reason. I am deathly afraid of centipedes, despite centipedes not being particularly dangerous to humans (at least not in North America) and I recognize that a centipede could just be squashed rather than feared, but that doesn't stop me from flipping my shit whenever I see a centipede. Finally there is URL , a well-known serial rapist and murderer of teenagers, who was also a clown and may have used that status to gain access to victims."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"Take Macklemore's win over Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys and on the charts: Kendrick is more technically proficient, more innovative, and offers a more complex emotional and political message. Crash won an Oscar over Brokeback Mountain (though it grossed significantly less) despite (or perhaps because of) heavy-handed, saccharine moralizing. A ""big message"" doesn't necessarily lead to superior art, and the idea that the biggest or most award-winning of a genre are also the best examples of that genre is demonstrably false."
t3_25k2ud,chi2ugu,"I understand why you want more, but Mumford has not demonstrated that they're interested or capable of writing the messages you want to hear. They are not obligated by merely borrowing elements of a sound, and despite their success they're not (as far as I know) widely labeled as the best modern folk has to offer. Their messages aren't even negative, just shallow and bland."
t3_25397z,chdaywd,"For all his stoner musings and non-aggressive tone, MF DOOM (actually, just DOOM now) speaks to much of the same subject matter -- at times sympathetically, but not always. Yet I suspect you wouldn't silence him, despite that impressionable types might be mislead by his words -- words that generally discuss antiheroes, drugs, and violence. To change your view, I need to better understand the heart of your discomfort."
t3_225qcm,cgjw5o8,UKIP (much though I disagree with their policies!) are gaining ground - despite not winning a single seat they are shaping the political debate at the moment. You can change things.
t3_21w3iu,cgh85yd,"We're humans, we can be wrong. ); Also, it is entirely possible that when someone argues using logic in that manner, it is because they feel they or their viewpoints are being attacked, and it is actually an emotional response to that attack, rather than pure logic, despite logical constructs being used for the actual argument. This brings me to the main point of this whole wall of text: Logic and Emotions are not opposites, nor are they mutually exclusive ; some people react to the anger stimulus (albeit as a trained response) by becoming scathingly logical, for lack of a better term."
t3_21pkk6,cgfbywq,"Those who can understand their condition and the question, often have (understandably) emotional reactions to it. Arguments that ""I'm fine, I did okay despite it"" are irrelevant to the question at hand, because it could easily be argued that they would have done even better without it. More importantly, those considering if this behavior is acceptable must (as much as possible) do the maths... what, if any, are the advantages of this condition?"
t3_21hpd2,cgdk0xf,"At his juncture, I have a difficult time distinguishing between your morality and utilitarianism, because we have arrived at the point where we determine whether an action is moral based on pleasure outcomes associated with that action. Another consequence of this definition is that you must accept that unconscious beings like dogs can associate extrinsic value with things (despite their lack of consciousness), and you have to contend with their pleasure and pain as well. Am I missing something here?"
t3_20lgw6,cg5et32,"lol...that was the point of the counter argument i brought up. now, since you accept that biology isn't the determining factor in loving a kid, than isn't in conceivable that in some situation parents can love their adopted child as much as a biological child, despite knowing the truth? How about a loving married couple who can not conceive for some reason or another, wouldn't having a kid (Even adopted) make them the happiest couple ever, and love the kid as much as a biological one?"
t3_1zyxf5,cfykpyh,"That's because our understanding of nuclear weapons are shaped by shared understandings about who has them. British nuclear weapons look different to Americans than do Russian nuclear weapons, despite the fact that British weapons could just as easily kill Americans. It is thus entirely conceivable that a war could be fought because one side believes that enemy leadership (however defined) would never use them -- due to a pre-existing characterization of enemy leadership or perhaps a miscalculation."
t3_1yzk2r,cfpix2k,"It was scary how much he still didn't remember or understand just how crazy he was to have gotten there in the first place. You'd almost think that this had been one of the cases you describe, where someone is committed against their will despite being perfectly sane. And yet... and yet..."
t3_1y93n4,cfilbka,"What makes Superman a great character? It's that, despite having the powers of a fucking god , he's always maintained his humanity. It's part of the reason it's so important for him to have a secret identity; without an ""ordinary"" life as Clark Kent, he'd soon loose touch with the concerns of ""ordinary"" mortals."
t3_1y93n4,cfilbka,"That's dedication. If Batman in the Nolanverse is impressive because he has become the most perfect crimefighter in the world, Batman in the DC universe is more impressive because he still tries to become the best crimefighter in the world, despite KNOWING HE WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS SUPERMAN. The relationship itself is also fun to explore."
t3_1y0vu9,cfgiaw0,"They DIDN'T see it as some horrible tragedy, but instead saw it the way we hope they would, as a fact of life and a learning experience. So I would say that, despite our best efforts to shelter them, luckily kids remain curious and inquisitive. "
t3_1xg9o8,cfbcvic,"I think you can see the problem. Even assuming teachers are extraordinarily careful gun owners, and despite the fact that they spend all day surrounded by misbehaving kids, the number of accidental shootings would still be twice the annual average for deliberate shootings. And of course we have no idea just how much of a deterrent effect arming teachers would have on those deliberate shootings."
t3_1x8fy5,cf9c8ws,"(And for reference, I am a scientist myself with twenty-plus years in the field and over one hundred publications.) By your definition, any university faculty member who hasn't published recently is not a scientist, despite having been one in the past. Any undergraduate or graduate student doing research but who has not yet published is not a scientist."
t3_1x8fy5,cf9c8ws,"Luminaries would be dropped off your list of scientists (Einstein, Feynman, Schwinger) for portions of their scientific careers when they were less active professionally. You'd strip them of their title as scientist despite their participation in scientific endeavors (e.g., serving as members of the National Academy of Science). This is bizarre."
t3_1x3quk,cf82a08,"These photos are not here to shock or repulse; they're not placed on reddit to shame the subject or repulse the viewer. They're placed on reddit, and upvoted by redditors, specifically because the posters and voters thought, in their heart of hearts, despite what polite society would have us think, that they could bring joy to a whole lot of people by sharing a simple photo with others. Thus, that picture of a girl's ass filling up most of your front page as you scroll down the page is representative of what makes reddit a beautiful, magical place: that things are shared out of kindness and upvoted with goodwill, and even though we may not agree with everyone on the site, even though we might despise a lot of the content, we know that we're mostly just decent people who are looking to enjoy ourselves for a little while on the internet, and we're not going to spoil some arbitrary rules about what is acceptable in polite company ruin our good time."
t3_1x3jm2,cf7t9mu,"The question of the night was ""Does the creationist theory hold as a viable model for where we came from?"" not ""Can a creationist become a scientist, despite being a creationist?"" The only point that Ken Ham had to stand on (when he wasn't pointing back to ""The bible tells me it is real"") was ""We weren't around to see the rings on the trees, or the layers of ice and how they were formed, so this is all speculative"" and the rebuttal to that from Nye boiled down to ""We are extrapolating backwards using what we know to make predictions"", or put another way ""If something consistently behaves in a certain manner, the longer it happens that way, the more certain I can be that it will continue happening that way, and the more certain I can be that it happened that way in the past."""
t3_1ty0ux,cecn1ju,"You didn't do it because a lot of people don't fully grasp the overall picture of weight management. People have varying degrees of knowledge about what it takes to gain, lose, or maintain their weight and proper body composition and far more often than not I see weight issues in people who are dedicated and willing to put in the time and effort for weight loss, they just don't know how despite lots of attempted research into the area. On top of that there's the fact no human being can dedicate themselves 100% to everything they care about."
t3_1t9irv,ce5spfk,"It's not clear what Paul was specifically referring to. While one could still argue that this includes homosexuality, if one did not believe homosexuality to be deviancy (like most Christians are fine with oral sex despite some claiming it to be deviant), then these verses do not condemn homosexuality. My personal belief on the matter is a bit less sure."
t3_1r0hue,cdickm4,"Imagine what you would do if you had no family to support you, and you were laid off and could not find a job -- you could very quickly become homeless without doing anything ""wrong"", just because you lacked the resources or support to stay off the streets. From the way you present your view, it also seems like you already know that homeless people cannot all be lumped together, but you just need some examples or evidence to help you recognize the many ways that someone can become homeless despite being a generally upstanding and decent person. I think it would be helpful to read through some of the past posts on /r/IAMA by homeless people."
t3_1qo0aj,cderzi3,"Game of Thrones is a great series that is set in a very sexist world, but still manages to have a strong cast of developed and interesting female characters. The plot isn't driven by men doing manly things, it's driven forward by everyone, regardless of gender despite being set in a sexist time. Men and women can enjoy it because there are characters they can all identify with in some way and root for."
t3_1qe6d9,cdbzgva,"quote came URL This is contrary to a URL which stated that people with ""deep-seated homosexual tendencies"" may not become priests. HOWEVER , this despite this document, it has been my observation that gay men in the Catholic Church are actually pressured into the priesthood by other Catholics. They are encouraged into celibacy (since, you know, gay sex is bad)."
t3_1pacrh,cd0cttu,"Why on earth should I or anyone else segregate ourselves to indulge the spiteful whims of self righteous prod-noses? My country legalised civil unions 8 years ago to vehement opposition from religious groups, despite the fact that a word other than 'marriage' was used. The issue here isn't really marriage, it's that some people want to punish gays just for being gay, and will do so in any forum that presents itself."
t3_1ozdmq,ccx5i2g,"The same psychology that makes us value our own people's lives over theirs, makes them value their own people's lives over ours. While there are many occasions of different groups being able to get along despite such biases, when the groups are put into conflict with each other they naturally form a degree of animosity for each other. We might be able to sympathize with the fact that the terrorists are fighting for their people and their beliefs, but the fact that they are fighting us triggers a feeling of an in-group vs out-group, colloquially know as the ""us vs them"" mindset."
t3_1oyy6b,ccxhhv9,"Japan and south korea are much more culturally similar to each other than to vietnam, but both are more allied to the western powers than to any asian one. Turkey is a still muslim nation, despite being more friendly to the west. kazakhstan is also a muslem country and should be in green."
t3_1nh939,ccikqy0,"The ACA was passed by Congress, signed by Obama, and upheld by SCOTUS. On top of that, Obama was reelected despite opposition to the ACA. The GOP at this point is desperate."
t3_1ncq4g,cchg2hg,"Because I'm not single. And for the past 8 years or so, I've been horrible at remaining single, despite several sacred oaths to stop dating. But I'm also short, poor, unemployed, a few rare shades of mentally ill, a few common types of physically ill and I'm certainly not making up for it in looks."
t3_1n3wo2,ccfdwg9,"While society would be better off if we did expel most of the anti-vaxxers to third world countries, some of them are not wrong to at least pay attention to what goes into their bodies and those of their kids for the latest-generation stuff: people haven't completely forgotten about URL (not a vaccination, but still a pharmacological disaster). People want stuff to be proven to be safe beyond a shadow of a doubt before they put it into their bodies or those of their kids, despite such a guarantee being near-impossible to achieve (like GMOs today, or the persistence of the autism link lie). While I agree that religious grounds are not a valid reason for anything whatsoever, forcefully violating someone's personal bodily integrity against their will is really no better than state-ordered intercourse: some may decide to roll with it and have fun, some may be horribly traumatized by it - it's all in the mind of the person on the receiving end."
t3_1n3wo2,ccfmxhg,"At first you may not share my intuition, but consider what it means to go about forcing a person to be vaccinated. It may mean anything from forcibly holding the person down and giving them the vaccination as they struggle and try to stop you to threatening to extort money from the person or imprison the person and actually employing force to extort money from the person or imprison the person if they still refuse to be vaccinated despite your threat. And even then, after you've extorted money from them, or imprisoned them, they still haven't been vaccinated."
t3_1lpfcx,cc1hmy1,"Siblings raised apart (say, separated at birth and meeting two decades later without knowing about their shared lineage) are still fairly likely to find each other extremely sexually attractive. Genetically unrelated people who grow up together (stepbrothers and stepsisters, classmates in places where people aren't shuffled between different classrooms throughout elementary school) are unlikely to engage in sexual relationships despite lack of genetic relation because of this effect, as well. EDIT: turns out that the westermark effect is no longer accepted, and that at least one meta-study indicates that it seems to be bullshit: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-011-1145-y#page-1 ."
t3_1lilfq,cbzrtfb,"I have more information than I would have had in the absence of their fashionability. Just as the peacock is signaling real things about their fitness to the peahen with their outrageous tail-feather display (notably an ability to survive real dangers despite possessing such outrageous plumage, and a freedom from certain genetic defects), so too does the well tailored man signal things to his employer by wearing a suit that flatters his figure, is well tailored, is well complemented by his tie, and is appropriate to the occasion. "
t3_1ld6h6,cby2a8w,"This is probably the historical reason for the right not to self-incriminate 2. Sometimes the police will ask very leading questions, and you may fear that almost any answer to those questions will then incriminate you (despite being innocent). The police can testify that you said an answer with some kind of sneer or showed nervousness or failed to register surprise, etc."
t3_1lbmj6,cbya367,"In Batman's opinion, convictions are malleable and easily corrupted. He can't understand or conceive of a person who, having chosen to do the right thing, will keep making that choice despite the difficulties it presents. - On an equally important note, the Superman/Clark dichotomy is especially intriguing once we consider that Clark (at least in most stories) willingly accepts the concerns of the ordinary man."
t3_1kmwmn,cbqml03,"But the turmoil created by the French Revolution was so disruptive to France that it spent the next century in bloody chaos- by the time they'd got things calmed down, France had been governed by three republics, two empires, two monarchies, and a number of transitional governments, with enormous attendant costs in human life and suffering. Another, more recent example is the abrupt transition of Russia away from totalitarian communism and towards democratic capitalism- it was an utter economic catastrophe for a solid decade, and ultimately resulted in an oligarchical basket case with the per capita GDP of Malaysia despite its immense natural resources and history of competing with the world's largest economy on even footing for decades. Even though it was trying to reform itself to incorporate the strengths of the ideologies that ended up beating it and now remain at the top of the heap."
t3_1kj8ll,cbpjmas,"Basically, it comes down to this: Do you believe someone can dictate another's sexual preferences? That they can ""know best"" despite the clear statements of that person about their own sexual identity? You telling me, ""No, you're not really straight, you do like members of the same sex, you just don't want to admit it"" is like conservative parents telling their gay son, ""No, you're not really gay, this is just a phase, you really do like girls."""
t3_1kj8ll,cbpjmas,"You telling me, ""No, you're not really straight, you do like members of the same sex, you just don't want to admit it"" is like conservative parents telling their gay son, ""No, you're not really gay, this is just a phase, you really do like girls."" Both are predicated upon the speaker knowing how the person really feels, despite that person's years of self-discovery. You describe a world that might be better in principle, but that is ultimately just your unfulfilled ideal."
t3_1j04ik,cb9skkn,"Then you lose. Despite all of the practice you put in, despite trying as hard as you possibly could, your chance of finally living out your ultimate fantasy has passed you by despite being just outside your grasp. I dunno, that kind of seems like it would suck."
t3_1j012y,cb9qn8t,The fact she's in revealing clothing could all just be circumstantial considering she's on a date. It's much like how we wouldn't say earrings increase the likelihood of being raped despite most victims probably having earrings (I'm assuming). 
t3_1io050,cb6cyg7,"Likewise, Data is meant to be similar. In other words, something distinct from a drone, as is inferred by the queen stating that Picard is no different than other drones (in that he was assimilated despite his free will), to which Picard responds that his case was different because she wanted ""more than just another Borg drone"". All this seems to point to that drones are not given choice and that Picard and Data were unique."
t3_1ijxex,cb5alhn,"We are killing them (primarily) because they attacked us, but also because they illegitimately seized control of civilians in a territory and treat them like shit.

t3_1hqnv9,cawybgj,"For example, imagine telling the survivor of an attempted homicide that they need to try strangulation again, with someone they love? It can feel wonderful, after all, despite the risks associated with it. Alternatively, imagine telling anyone who nearly died in a car crash, that wanting to drive again was proof they alone were responsible for the accident?"

t3_1fl5d8,cabci41,"You appear to have overlooked the possibility that there are some hypotheses which are not provable or disprovable. For example, it is totally reasonable for a scientist to say, ""I reject radical skepticism and believe a world exists outside my mind"" despite the fact this cannot be proven true by evidence. More importantly, it is completely reasonable for a scientist to say, ""Such and such a practice is unethical"", despite the fact that ethics - almost by design - is not the sort of thing where propositions are truth-bearing in the classical sense of supporting a hypothesis test."

I don't have to feel bad about American imperialism, despite the fact that it's responsible for many thousands of deaths and I've directly benefited from it, but I should acknowledge it and take measures to fix it. Now, if you don't want to acknowledge the problem and/or want to do anything to fix it... then I would argue that you should feel bad."
t3_1f93x1,ca88try,"Therefore your particle is now in the opposite observation state as mine, and so your 4D event is selected via this probabilistic collapse.

t3_1enjqf,ca2npl0,"It's just that when talking about sexuality, people are talking about inherent interest and accepting it, not about the people you ultimately end up sleeping with. So, despite essentially agreeing with most rational people on not being able to choose who you're inherently attracted to, you're going to keep getting into arguments over schematics until you realize that this just isn't how the language around sexuality currently is, whether or not you think it should be.

t3_1dj741,c9qwjmm,"What stopped me then, after my English became more decent, is the finding that language has a huge influence on how people perceive the world. And when I thought about it, not much of the great minds in history had English as their native language, despite the wide-spread of it. This to me suggest a possibility that other languages, more complex languages, like Chinese or Russian or even German, have other qualities, which might be more important than simplicity."

We're (men) the bad guy, despite the fact that both the man and the woman chose to have unprotected sex together.

t3_1cbyg8,c9f2fbr,"In fact, the easiest way to make me feel bad about myself is to make me feel dumb (which happens more often these days). However, I also know a great number of people who work and live on small farms and ranches who are genuinely good people, despite having no more than a high school education (and sometimes not even that). Being smart is a great thing, but so is having any special talent, whether it's wisdom (which is arguably much different than knowledge), athletic ability, patience, etc."
t3_1bxgut,c9b7tag,What if someone happens to be both a parent and incredibly smart and well educated. Should they be allowed to teach their own children despite the fact that it will give the child an unfair advantage over others simply because of who his parents are? There is no conceivable way to enforce a statute against instructing your own child and I don't think such a law would have many advocates in any event.
t3_1are2i,c902a8w,"If you purchase a CD, should you be permitted to rip it to MP3 on your computer, put it on your iPod, and use the intro to a song as your ringtone? Major copyright holders believe that all four of those uses should be separate purchases, despite being the same creative material. I'd have a very hard time accepting an argument that using one copy for those four purposes should be illegal, let alone calling it theft."
t3_1ajjfw,c8y2o8t,"That's one major chunk of privilege when you don't have to handle the same stressful situations every day.

t3_33ltmy,cqmaxor,"I'll just try to give you some things to think about. It seems to me that if you've made it this far with your ethics intact, it may well be the case that the high paying job will make you equally as unhappy, despite the wage increase. I can't argue against the value of the increased wages, especially for your family, but I think you ought to consider some of the other benefits of the non-profit gig."
t3_335312,cqhqb8z,"Let me give you every reason that Kanye West is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat, who had provided nothing but top-tier music since his debut. Let me school you with some straight facts: Kanye, despite his publicity stunts, is regarded by many as a kind, compassionate individual. He often talks to his fans, and from all accounts is genuinely interested in what they have to say, what their life is like, and what their goals are."
t3_332jn0,cqgxjbr,"If was formulated by Thomas Aquinas and still used today by some philosophers and theologians, mainly in discussions of medical ethics and war ethics. Essentially, it says that an action is morally good despite foreseen negative consequences if: 1) the nature of the act is good or neutral itself 2) the good is intended and bad is not 3) the good outweighs the bad Now, a utilitarian would only accept the third of these principals, but if you're willing to accept that these are morally relevant features for some other legitimate moral frameworks, you should be able to see the differences between the trolley problem and the transplant problem. In the trolley problem, all three points are fulfilled."
t3_309gc1,cpr1ni1,"According to the Supreme Court in Texas v White (1869), a state cannot unilaterally secede from the union. Imagine if when we colonized the Philippines, we decided to turn them into a state in order to protect our democratic values, despite the fact that the people there overwhelmingly did not want to be a state. Sure, now they can vote, but they're trapped in a union they don't want."
t3_3090lj,cpq7mbv,"The problem isn't that the modern feminist movement contains troubling racist/homophobic/trans-exclusionary elements. The problem is that the feminist movement is over a century old and has many distinct sub-movements within it, and some of the older sub-movements still allow for those racist, homophobic, and trans-exclusionary individuals to cling to the identity of ""feminist"" despite their regressive, out-of-date attitudes.

Do you think it's possible that even despite not knowing any of that stuff too well, an average adult still has a fairly decent grasp on politics? Secondly, why do you believe the average voter needs to be educated in order to produce good results?"
t3_2ziiud,cpjaj55,"You're not just presuming that all religion is wrong, you're presuming that no religious person actually believes what they claim they do and that they are willfully deluding themselves. So in other words: you feel that the falsehood of religion is a foregone conclusion despite the billions who disagree with you.

t3_2x854p,coxwtm2,"""All I want is what I can't buy now"" addresses Kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""All Falls Down"" ""We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom""). The entire fourth verse could be a darker repurposing of the ideas in ""All Falls Down"" where he laments all the struggles he still endures as a black man today despite his success like constantly being told no when he wants to buys lavish things like Benzes, cocaine, etc. (symbolic for success in hip hop), the desire that is perpetuated towards women to get support from successful rappers or athletes, and the parallel between the two."
