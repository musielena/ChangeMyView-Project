t3_2mptvb,cm6m7jr,"I can't speak for all women, but when I was still single, what frightened me was not feeling like I could trust men. Feeling like even someone who seems nice could just be doing anything to get some sex, and that once that happened they wouldn't care anymore, and if it never happened cause I was onto that bullshit, they'd be all offended because ""oh, you don't like nice guys after all, then?!"" So what I wanted wasn't a matter of surface behavior that seemed ""nice guy"" vs. ""alpha"", it was a matter of finding someone I could trust."
t3_2bqdam,cj828mm,"However, I assume the long-term goal here is financial independence. If that is true, it is very important to maximize the amount you invest in every way possible, so even something as small as $500 is significant. "
t3_2bk0qs,cj66iuo,"However, if you do just a little bit of research you quickly will reach the conclusion that to those affected by the original crime, they get no real satisfaction in seeing the offender suffer. And it makes sense that it would be that way: if your daughter is raped and murdered, and you see the bastard that did it raped and murdered, you may well feel a little twinge of happiness at first, but then (a) you quickly remember that your daughter is STILL dead and STILL suffered the rape, and (b) that now you actually feel a little bit disgusted with yourself because you felt joy about the suffering of someone else, even someone that ""deserved it"". MOST people aren't wired that way thankfully..."
t3_2ay3kf,cj0s4zc,"Because contrary to popular belief, the way a person uses grammar has little to do with their intelligence. But even so, there is a need for the grammar and spelling rules to be there when it comes to written language. If there is no standard, there is no way to teach a language and you end up with a whole lot of illiterate people."
t3_25mebn,chile88,"There does tend to be a focus on womens issues in feminism, but that's because of how feminism started - with women who were tired of being told they couldn't have a job after they were married, couldn't vote, couldn't be engineers or or bricklayers or athletes, couldn't dress in a way that made them feel confident. However, as women have gained greater rights to vote, work and pursue what dreams they have, feminism has broadened to address the parts of the Patriarchy that harm both men and women equally in different ways, and even some aspects that harm only the men. It is still more widely supported by women and thus still gets more attention on the womens issues side of things, but there are a lot of male feminists in the world - including a variety of actors, authors, musicians and other famous people you'd be familiar with."
t3_1y7dly,cfi0whe,"While some sports are less susceptible to referees' and judges' tampering, I'd argue that none is safe from it. And in the end, the spirit of the games, ultimately, is competition and camaraderie and even some of the more subjectively scored sports offer this in spades. Incidentally, from 1918 to 1948, they even gave out Olympic medals in URL such as sculpture, literature, and architecture."
t3_1v6x7z,cepid1d,"Programs are being put in action to stop much of what has been seen by the media. Hell, there are even some at the higher levels that actually give a shit and truly want things to change. Things are changing, and I understand why you'd want what you do."
t3_1mxo4i,ccdoxu0,"The point is to do as little harm as possible, and I'd say being about 85% responsible vs thousandths of a percent isn't even worth comparing. I'm curious why you characterize torturing and killing animals for ""pure, sadistic pleasure"" as immoral, and then go on to suggest that making any moral judgment of another's treatment of animals is unfair if the judge is in even some, circuitous way engaged in behavior which results in animal suffering. In so doing, aren't you drawing as arbitrary a line as the judgmental vegans who bother you so much?"
t3_1kag5w,cbn0mxn,"This does not, of course, confirm that we are the ones making the decisions, but it is a step closer to that conclusion. There is even some debate as to whether there is a comprehensive, universal theory. According to a great Hawking book I read about physics, there are currently three things that could be true about our ability to understand the universe: The laws of our universe are impossible to understand; they cannot be fathomed and we'll never get there."
t3_1cjeto,c9h2lgb,"As for the aged aspect, I'll continue to use whisky as the example because that's what i enjoy. If you can accept that people even somewhat enjoy whisky, then the next thing to understand is this: aged whiskey is just better in every way. It's smoother, the flavors are both gentler and more pronounced."
t3_32ml8o,cqcp8hx,"Everyone has different standards of morals. Some say gay marriage is immoral, some say porn and booze is, but as we've seen with court decisions even southern red states are overturning gay marriage bans. Morally, I agree with you, but legally these teachers broke the law knowingly."
t3_324yj6,cq7zfq6,"You can tell the police officer to go away (refusal), you can ignore him, or you could open the door (comply). If you comply, and you have an illegal substance, weapon, or even something that looks like one in your house visible from the door, the police officer has reasonable cause to search your home-- immediately. Even if the police officer thinks he smells an illicit substance, he can search your home."
