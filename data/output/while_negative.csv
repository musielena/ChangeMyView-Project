t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"However, this is obviously foolish because countless geniuses have already made those discoveries; it makes much more sense to learn about what's already been discovered, even if (and especially if) you hope to make new discoveries yourself. And to assume that a person who knows very little about math could come up with those theories is, while strictly theoretically true, practically ridiculous. The same goes for philosophy."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's Tractatus , but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference. So for the reason alone that it is virtually impossible to reach high levels of philosophy without first understanding the foundations, studying philosophy is a worthwhile endeavor because it gives the student access to knowledge that would have been highly arcane to them had they not studied the subject. But your main argument seems to be that studying philosophy is a waste of time because it has no practical use."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"Some use college as an opportunity to train for professional skills, others see it as a way to grow themselves as people and learn more about the world in general before getting a job and no longer having the opportunity. Both of these are worthwhile notions, and the very fact that people choose to study philosophy as opposed to more ""useful"" majors is proof that its existence is highly desirable at least to the people who are interested in it. The biggest takeaway I get from your post is that you did not study philosophy, and you have somewhat of a misunderstanding of what it is."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible. At the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject."

t3_2rkzen,cnhbiku,"Miraculously, she ended up surviving. As doctors tried to figure out what they did to save the girl, they eventually discovered that she had a special mutation that essentially made her immune to rabies - while she was certainly sick, she was one of the very, very few people carrying the right gene that made rabies about as dangerous as the cold. She may have had the highest IQ on earth, she may have had down syndrome."

t3_2rk7my,cngpiso,"Driving there is a 1 in 1 million chance that you're going to be killed in an accident, maybe a 1 in 10,000 chance that you'll be in an accident at all. You have a strange definition of ""risky""; while it's true a mistake can cost you your life, they often don't (cars have been getting safer since the 1920s) and the fact is that because so many people spend so much time driving, we are better at it than a lot of other things and so are much more likely to not make those mistakes (though, sadly, they do happen). I define ""risky"" as a high likelihood that something out of your control can kill you in the given activity, and the things that can kill you and aren't in your control to some degree in a car are very infrequent."
t3_2rexe3,cnfgbjs,"As for discounts, a lot of the companies around here DO offer discounts to emergency services, they just don't advertise them. However, I'd like to call out a few companies that DO, just in case any other emergency workers are looking: Menchie's Frozen Yogurt (100% discount while on-shift and in-uniform). Rooster's Men's Grooming ($5 - $10 off a full package haircut) Army/Navy Surplus (10% off) McDonald's (Free drinks while on-shift in the drive-thru) There's others, but I can't think of them right now."

t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"They both are have excellent parts plus really shitty parts. To un-ironically call 4chan an echo chamber while on reddit is the most absurd thing I've read for quite some time. Reddit has always been a big hugbox for pseudo-intellectualism, sophomoric ""me too"" inside joke threads that go on forever, and feel-good emotional bullshit."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"Reddit has a bunch of dickheads trying to start a thread from the same link (all racing for karma) and then the thread will have to gain enough momentum to appear on the front page so unless I'm in the /new/ wasteland, I am behind the curve. 4chan may have it posted multiple times within seconds/minutes as well, but the one with the most enticing headline and immediate comments will always appear on the front page (or at least in the catalog) and the successful thread is the one used to near capacity, then redirected to the next big thread all the while without karma whores pushing eachother for control...the would-be karma whores are simply wasting their time trying to use a thread that's not as popular about a same topic. So while I've already discussed the news of the day on 4chan, I can discuss the news of yesterday on reddit."

t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"You're completely correct in the belief that medical people going to Africa to treat ebola are putting themselves at risk of catching ebola, but all-in-all the chance of catching ebola in a controlled environment is very low, so low in fact that the news continues to report on each case that occurs. While others have compared to firemen, the analogy doesn't do the ebola workers justice, as 93 firemen died on duty in 2013 while only a handful of ebola volunteers have died. Of course there are many more firemen than there are ebola volunteers."
t3_2r6a86,cnd9u6t,"Yes, if I was such a good player, I could dodge. But giving an item that makes it a one-hit kill to one player, while making the other player play defense is bullshit. It makes the game about who got the smash ball, not who's better."
t3_2r4u3k,cncnikt,"Establishing an environment of professionalism and productivity is crucial for a business to be successful, and the way that individuals dress impacts the general atmosphere of an environment pretty heavily . For instance, if I am attending a wedding and I am dressed in jeans and a tee-shirt while everone else is dressed in a suit and tie, I am going to feel uncomfortable - at a wedding this would not have much of an impact except making me feel out of place. But it can be argued that feeling uncomfortable in a work environment would likely lower a person's productivity which is a relevant factor to an employer."
t3_2r39y4,cnc69pi,"See. my issue is that people are using ""gay"" as a synonym for ""bad"" and while you don't hear it as much anymore, a good chunk of people say ""straight"" to mean good. So you have to wonder if that maybe it might just start to subvert our thinking and possibly start to create, at least in our minds, the parallels that are implied with that slang."
t3_2qtorn,cn9ezot,"In your examples, I think you have two different purposes behind the single sex institutions. In shelters, it is a way for women who have been abused by men to feel safe while moving on. I certainly think that there should be easily available men only facilities in the same way, where men can feel safe."
t3_2qncj3,cn7wgim,"Again, this can be something the military has almost no need of, meaning you're stuck in a residency that you don't actually want (for 3-7 years), and then have 5 years of service after that is over, too. Third, while you get paid during school (and your school is free), you'll be earning enough after you finish a civilian residency that your educational debt if you went the civilian route would be insignificant. It's not financially worthwhile to go the military route, ever."

Generally speaking, compared to your next best alternative, it's often not worth it to become a doctor, either (see: https://benbrownmd.wordpress.com/ as just one exampple), especially after you start accounting for the possibility of you dropping out during training (for whatever reason) and burnout rates after you've finished training."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7i1ds,"While I'm sure many do it just for attention, I know for a fact that not everyone who posts nudes does so for attention. Some are just incredibly horny and in the process of masturbation and posting nude photos while masturbating is just one more masturbation ""tool,"" like vibrators and porn, that enhances masturbation and orgasm. I'd say posting nudes is more akin to cyber sex chatting than attention seeking selfie picture posting for people like this."
t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"And like networking, understanding how the ""standard"" process works and can be manipulated is a skill that is going to be disproportionately found in upper class applicants. Meanwhile now you're removing an avenue by which less advantaged applicants who have already proven themselves and built professional relationships to stand out as the excellent applicants they are. tl;dr - Hiring is really hard."
t3_2qia6o,cn76xcf,"Its something that anyone can (and should) learn and practice.

"
t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"It just pushes the bubble so to speak to other areas where the same people still have a considerable advantage. Meanwhile, the disadvantaged folks who have already proven themselves as excellent employees have the connections they've built nullified and are sent into the pile full of carefully manicured resumes. If you want to dispute the advantage that already well-off folks have in resume writing and interviewing on the grounds that these are just skills that anyone could learn, then I feel like you have to acknowledge that networking is also a skill that anyone can learn."
t3_2q6k6o,cn3ddwl,"You get their side of the story. They act like shitty overgrown children, attract shitty women, and tell you all about how those women fulfill one of those criteria up there, and how that makes all women shitty all the while being on the same playing field as pathological victims or equally-responsible shitty people . All of the good women (and there are plenty), take one look at these guys and get the fuck out of there."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her ""seemingly minor"" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu. I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all."
t3_2ps2mr,cmzyju1,"Regarding your second part : ""....most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease, and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy."" Sure, while anyone can string rhyming words together and recite them over a beat.. That does not make it a good rap song. Much in the same way, someone can learn 3 chords and sing a rough melody, but it doesn't make it a good song."
t3_2ppxgu,cmz3hz0,"It has less than 60,000 subscribers, nearly 1/3 of this subreddit, and is hated by the majority of reddit. If it were a serious place were racist/sexist comments could be discussed &amp; debated while regarding the context and nuances it would be great. But it isn't."
t3_2pnm9s,cmycunf,"Sure, the us penal system could be better focused on rehab than on ounishment, but I think your homeless guys are the minority. Additionally, they are saying this while on the outside. There are plenty of guys getting out on parole after 20 years so obviously they feel the opposite."
t3_2pnm9s,cmycunf,"As for it being a human rights violation, I think that might be overstating it a bit. Sure, kt is an uphill battle, but they only have to support themselves so while their job prospects are limited if they are dedicated it is possible to make ends meet. As for your homeless guys chances are they have mental disorders that are more the issue than the amount of prison time they have had."
t3_2pimzj,cmy635r,"I would argue or ignore, but each time I argued, or saw a joke challenging my beliefs or looked into another one, those arguments stuck better and better, til eventually years later I admitted it didnt really make sense to me.

t3_2pata1,cmuzku3,"Also, it's factually incorrect to assert that intelligence is fixed from parents' intelligence. We know that many things can affect intelligence, including nutrition while in the womb, environmental factors (lead paint/pipes in homes), early childhood nutrition, etc. A study released recently showed that people who hear more and different words in their first years of life often develop much stronger vocabularies."
t3_2p3d0h,cmt2dzd,"On the one hand, I'd have a difficult time really understanding where my friend was coming from. If I woke up to find that while I was asleep, a close friend had fallen asleep cuddling with me, I'd think it was somewhat cute and sweet. I'd be puzzled if it were my best friend, because that would be out of character, but I wouldn't react anywhere near the way your friend is, so I'd have a hard time understanding if a friend of mine were reacting the way your friend is."
t3_2p04r0,cmt3cpf,I apologize if I misconstrued his writings. It's been a while since I have read his book. I will attempt to address all of this by readdressing the OP and more importantly the Intent of the OP.

t3_2p04r0,cmu4pf6,"But you would argue still that a PhD in genetics is on average more right than a layperson in ANY topic of genetics.

But then you would define that person to be an expert right?"

My own experience and reasoning for having children is that life was too easy (white male in north America), and while I can do much to help better the world around me, the best thing I can do for society is to make the next generation stronger by instilling it with my own values. Having kids is the best way to achieve this."

The aforementioned Makhno's Black Army offers some possible solutions - a democratically controlled army (as in, actual battlefield decisions were made by near-consensus) actively resisting the state-socialist Red Army in defending their territory (they might have been successful were it not for an outbreak of disease that killed much of the 103,000 person force)."

So while i guess it is immoral to eat meat, the fact of the matter is that millions of people do and hundreds of animals are killed for this meat, but like all industries, there is some waste, and it is often in grocery stores where the meat just isnt bought and ends up going bad. So my argument for continuing to eat meat is that its and industry that isnt going to go away, at least not in your lifetime, and by continuing to eat meat, at least you're giving some form of meaning to the animals death and keeping even a little bit more of it from being trashed."

You could argue that the young person would be better able to help the needy by going to college and starting a career, but that's little consolation to the needy who suffered and/or died while the young person got their career in motion.
