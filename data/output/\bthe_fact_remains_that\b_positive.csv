Given this does not have to occur, but the fact remains that the jobs that will be left will be those that require what AI and robots can't do--critical thinking, and if those are the jobs that are available, people will need to get into the practice of thinking critically. This will likely lead to a education revolution of sorts in which we start teaching kids how to think and question rather than just accept a bunch of random facts from disparate fields at face value."
t3_1scbek,cdw4ucf,"One of the reasons that depression is linked to things like drug abuse, ""bad decisions"", and antisociality is because people who are depressed tend to do or be these things because of their disorder. And, even if depression were always the result of the things you mentioned (which it isn't), the fact remains that once people are depressed they lack the ability to simply ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"". The neurology of depression is very complicated, but it's a medical disorder in the same way that any other mental disorder is."

It helps if the problem will get much larger by changing the status quo."
t3_32ml8o,cqcp6fe,"Students will always suffer if they have bad teachers, but they'll suffer even more if we have know way of knowing that their teachers are bad. Even if we both agree that the standard in place isn't the best way to determine the quality of the teacher, the fact remains that these teachers subverted the primary means of overseeing teachers. Rather than admit they were incapable or put the effort in to avoid failure, they lied."
