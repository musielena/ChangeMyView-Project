t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"What I meant was that the same underlying reasons why networking ""very clearly favors the already well-off"" as you put it also gives them a comparable advantage in every aspect of the process, including how to write a resume that gets noticed and how to present yourself well in an interview. So in addition to the practical problems with trying to ""regulate networking"", it doesn't even solve the problem. It just pushes the bubble so to speak to other areas where the same people still have a considerable advantage."
t3_2kcnzq,clk0kv6,"particularly for people buying less expensive cars, because they are more likely to spend that money savings of other things which will help diversify the economy, and give them more ability to sustain their budgets. and even so, it is just morally bankrupt for a bunch of auto-dealers to band together to force a competitor out of the market. competition is good for society."

t3_2g1ea5,cket437,"With pizza, I can take as much or as little as I want and have enough to have cold pizza for breakfast (who doesn't love cold pizza for breakfast??) Pizza slices are deliberately cut uneven so people can take the size that they want. "
t3_25im4s,chicfp4,"Not a different physical plane, a different metaphysical plane. Just as the study of the physical world has shown us that even some of our most basic concepts might be wrong, like how invisible electromagnetic fields exist or how time itself can be stretched and squeezed, so too it may be the case that our basic ideas about personhood and morality might not be correct from the perspective of the larger metaphysical reality beyond the physical universe. For example, maybe it doesn't make sense to say that eternal damnation is disproportionately long because ""eternal"" really means outside time ."

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"Certain things aren't as internalized by gentiles, and it doesn't tend to be as scary learning about what happened. It's not even something some gentiles grow up knowing about - they may be taught about it later in life, not necessarily when they're fairly young. While of course the whole world doesn't want to kill Jews, I feel like it's kind of a natural thing to feel when you've grown up with the fact that parts of your family were murdered because of this genocide that tried to take people just like you out of the world."
t3_320ncw,cq7attb,"In a fictional realm her beliefs wouldn't sound so strange, would they? They wouldn't even sound wrong. If you can freely tell her what you believe, and she can freely tell you what she believes without either of you getting angry or upset with the fact that you two don't agree with each other, then you could just look at it as an interesting conversation with your dear mother who has a differing point of view about inconsequential matters of the spirit world."
t3_2yo9nm,cpbv2ve,"Income alone is not a good indication of ability to pay off loans. Cost of living is staggeringly different across the country, hell, even so within any given city. "
t3_2ujo2u,co98y0r,It was the blind leading the blind. And how many years does it take for even some enlisted grunt to realize that it's all going nowhere. That it's almost like the war only exists in powerpoint presentations.
