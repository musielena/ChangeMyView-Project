 Production is irregular; I pay for healthcare but I want health, and I can't guarentee that my purchase of healthcare will result in health Avoidance of using the service is impossible (or at least very unlikely), meaning I cannot purchase a substitute to healthcare

 Moreover, when I use the service I am (usually) not a rational consumer - a man having a heart attack can't pick a hospital four hours away because it has better reviews on Yelp, and even if he tells paramedics he wants to go there they would be negligent if they didn't just completely ignore him."
