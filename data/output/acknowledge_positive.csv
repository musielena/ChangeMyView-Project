With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed.

t3_2pjmrj,cmxddb6,s. 15). This is important b/c constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written (it's really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intent-based interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US that's a very controversial doctrine).
t3_2oo3qw,cmp0nen,"Of course, that doesn't change the fact that the prominent Republican criticisms of it rely on ad hominem arguments to oppose legitimately problematic policies (that they would, in all actuality, probably be okay with if their guy was in the White House). Ever since 2010 we've seen this kind of political posturing against the Obama administration, and while that campaign has been intellectually dishonest and very damaging in some ways, it's important to acknowledge and respect this persistent proportion of Americans who are genuinely not okay with the direction that the country is going. While the individual arguments they may articulate on any given issue can come across as fallacious, there's an underlying cognitive shortcut in their opposition that stems from the fact that they disagree with the principles that President Obama and the Democratic Party use to justify their policies."
t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"Your judgment is not going to be perfect. So I would think by your logic we would have to acknowledge that your framework is also immoral. I don't though, because I reject the notion that imperfection implies immorality."
t3_2mo4fl,cm613kx,"For the sake of argument I will assume that this idea is true. However, if we acknowledge that everyone is purely self-motivated, I do not believe that I am or should be responsible for the functioning of society. If it so happens that my motivation and associated actions work in the favor of everyone else (as well as myself, of course), it is nothing more than a happy coincidence."
t3_2kose9,clnb50a,"You can't just get the government 'out of marriage' by turning it into a traditional contractual relationship because you would still have to get rid of statutorily created rights/benefits/privileges/presumptions that were drafted independently, and; 2. Since it's unlikely that we'll just reform these laws piecemeal, each individual law can still dictate what kind of relationships it chooses to acknowledges for the purpose of that statute, i.e., still discriminate against 'peculiar' kinds of relationships. We saw (2) arise when some states legalized gay marriage but those couples only had equal status in state law, not federal law, pre-*Windsor*."
t3_2k1puo,clh65uf,"However, I can try: Many anti-death penalty advocates advocate against it because there are other alternatives to the death penalty in our modern, effective society, such as rehabilitation. I think most anti-death penalty advocates would acknowledge that rehabilitation would be impossible if society collapsed. Therefore, they could still rationalize killing someone if there was no alternative (unlike in modern society where there are alternatives)."
t3_2j7gwy,cl96wx9,"Mea culpa. Looking at your first link, OP didn't necessarily participate a lot, but every time they did participate it was to acknowledge a good point, and overall they thanked the group for providing a lot of useful ideas for clarifying what he thought (and indeed, he agreed eventually that giving to charities that supported the homeless was a better idea than giving to the homeless themselves, which is a significant change in viewpoint). I would count that one as one of CMV's successes."
t3_2isiv7,cl525xl,"Second this path leads to madness because, if it is acceptable to ban the very stupid from voting, why not also ban those of average intelligence and leave the vote to the truly smart ones in society. Democracy is a shared acknowledgement that we are all in the same boat together and we should, together, determine the path it takes. Because immigration is optional I don't see that someone electing to board our boat should necessarily get a say in the direction it goes without proving some basic level of competency."
t3_2gmkz2,ckkm4uh,"In URL it is illegal to hold public office and be an Athiest. And to your second point, I don't know about the other states, but here in AR you have to publicly acknowledge your belief in God to hold a liquor license at your place of business. My atheist co-worker flipped his shit when he went to apply for our license and found that out."
t3_2g8jj7,ckguu40,"The substantive change in your view that I think this all requires is simple: you move from ""heterosexual sex work is incompatible with gender equality"" to ""heterosexual sex work is incompatible with gender equality if sex work is inevitably gender-asymmetric ."" It's a small change, but an important one because it acknowledges the (not yet proven) assumption you're making. You're absolutely right: it is an empirical question, not an ethical one."
t3_2fgw85,ck94sl1,"I'm curious, have you ever pondered why other people care? Like -- why other people, who acknowledge that their lives are a blip on the cosmic timeline (if even that), keep going on in life? Or, what makes someone that is desperately clinging to life feel that way versus you who are contemplating tossing yours away."

t3_2cflx0,cjfajp7,"If anything, it paves the possibility for an early exit of Ulfric, which would be especially fortuitous were the Dragonborn to be interested in the job. As you have acknowledged, the Aldmeri Dominion is the true threat (not just to Skyrim, but to the world), but your belief in the Empire's ability to meet that threat (as it currently stands) seems unsupported. The Empire has already been beaten: their continued existence is due to last minute heroics and the cost of most of their autonomy."
t3_2btxhq,cj8vmab,"So for a pretty extensive run down of problems with the Guy, check out this blog (literally the 2nd google hit for him): http://fractalplanet.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/how-guy-mcpherson-gets-it-wrong/ Some of the easy to spot problems with his arguments: He focuses on only (or at least primarily) positive forcings in climate science to justify his claim it will accelerate so rapidly. Even the big time warners about global warming like James Hansen acknowledge we are uncertain about how negative and positive feedback loops will interact, and therefore exactly how quickly warming can be expected to occur. But not McPherson, he ignores all possible negative feedback loops."

t3_22xij5,cgrqv9h,"Although people can misuse the argument regarding privilege, the way it is discussed in an academic sense of the word is not an attempt to shame or belittle people. It is an attempt to acknowledge that there are structural advantages that some groups have, and that these advantages in and of themselves can end up shielding them from the plight that others face. I am a middle-class, white, able-bodied, heterosexual, cis-gendered man in higher education in a Western country."
t3_21tdqe,cggbp4k,The core value of the pro-choice stance is its preference of individual discretion to public uniformity.

t3_1ycqp3,cfjcixz,"Given the powerful connotations of the term ""racism"", a necessary first step towards legitimizing forms of prejudice other than ""real racism"" are to distance themselves from that concept.

t3_1rw7vg,cdrov9y,"Until basic human rights have been secured for women in such situations I think the focus on the female half of gender is morally sound and justifiable. Late to the party so not sure if anyone will see this: I think the real reason why we use the word ""Feminism"" is because we acknowledge that, although this is at heart an equality movement, many women are suffering to a much greater degree than men - and thus it is women that need to find a rallying ground in order to tackle their problems. Obviously men also have problems we need to address, and I wholeheartedly agree that men should be considered much more within the framework of feminism."
t3_1qz653,cdhyl9l,"I think this artist was trying to paint something that had all the technical value of a painting, but wanted to leave it empty of any culture, message, or meaning. He's not interested in telling people the meaning of something, he's interested in forcing the spirit to acknowledge nothingness and fill in the gaps with its own being. This is all very abstract, but think what happens when you look at the painting."
t3_1qz653,cdhyl9l,"Ever hear a description of silence being loud? This is because silence forces us to acknowledge that silence, and that can be a really uncomfortable, but enlightening, experience.

t3_1q370k,cd8rej1,"This is not true in the slightest!

t3_1lbmj6,cbya367,"What you write above is true: Superman is strong, fast, can fly, and has pretty much every power under the sun. That's why a good Superman story acknowledges this but demonstrates that none of that ultimately matters.

t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"The problem with framing such meaning making as a fundamentally religious question is that religion in general, and Christianity in particular usually presents itself not as an answer, not as one partial explanation , but as a totalizing and exclusive explanation (what Northorp Frye, himself a devout Christian, referred to as an apocalyptic symbolic regime). By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?). It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised."
