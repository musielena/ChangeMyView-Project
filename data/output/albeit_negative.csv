You can choose where the money goes by choosing what laws to vote for, what representatives to vote for, what policies to support and which to decry."
t3_2aymhj,cj0241x,"If the entire population adapted to a single set of traits/genetic predispositions we leave ourselves extremely vulnerable to targeted diseases/biological weapons. Perhaps most importantly, we reduce the possibility of ""happy accidents"" - a definitely useful (practically essential), albeit rare occurrence. Furthermore - it is nigh-impossible to know the best capacities, traits, and aesthetics in the long term of human evolution."
t3_2akhk0,ciw2nfc,"Not to mention the physical wellness benefits of playing (and watching inspires playing, thus indirectly giving this benefit). I'd go so far as to say that this happiness just from playing usually outweighs the unhappiness from losing, meaning that both teams gain happiness (albeit one much more so than the other) So between the unbalanced affects of wins and losses on happiness and the guaranteed happiness just from playing/watching, it seems that, in terms of happiness generated, sports are in no way a zero sum game. At the risk of sounding cheesy, it would seem that everyone is a winner."
t3_29d178,cijq08i,"People without diplomas still have the same rights as everyone else, they simply haven't had the same academic achievements which means that they may not necessarily have the same opportunities down the line. If this is your view on the purpose of a diploma, then who says that those with severe mental disabilities aren't able to function in a civilized society, albeit with some help? Also, I would hardly say that those without a diploma are excluded/shunned from society."
t3_26nxhn,chsv0n8,"But you didn't and I'm glad. All languages are undergoing change, albeit slowly. So in time, ""nigger"" may take on an entirely different connotation."
t3_24sel2,chab28m,"Was it ever an ""every day"" thing vs. a luxury? At least in my (albeit not that long yet) lifetime, there has always been the option of home-viewing / VCRs, and going to the movies was a ""treat"". That said, as a result of this change, and the increase of home-viewership, many more people experience the movies than ever have before."
t3_23ijp4,cgxdbde,"The purpose of the various postures is to allow practitioners to keep their bodies completely still for long periods of time while they focus their minds. In regard to yoga for physical health, there have been numerous studies linking meditation with physical and psychological well-being, and in fact URL (albeit tentatively), saying it ""causes the heart rate and breathing rate to slow down, the blood vessels to dilate (improving blood flow), and the flow of digestive juices increases."" Dr. James Austin, a neurologist and professor at the University of Missouri, has described meditation as being able to ""[rewire the brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Brain)""."
t3_1xqnjx,cfdvwqp,"The 1-2 minute process of looking through a dictionary now takes 1/2 a second. I'll be taking literature and composition next year or the year after that (albeit the college board's ""AP"" edition), and from what I've heard from friends, it reacquires alot of writing and taking notes while you read. Rather than have a book filled with a million doodles and post-it notes, why not have a clearly annotated e-book copy with pins on specific pages and a directory that points out where each pin was placed with a note on why it's there?"
t3_1nkqn7,ccjhz72,"Our URL , especially compared to many European countries. Our economy is URL , albeit slowly. The US is also a very diverse countries in terms of culture and people."
