t3_1er14x,ca2wyds,"The idea of jailing a rape victim for an abortion is abhorrent to many people, though, so the pro-life movement mostly does not seem to demand ideological consistency on this point (which is fine with me, since I'm pro-choice anyway)."
t3_1enop4,ca26n3f,"For example, to put it simplistically if you are analyzing states from a realist perspective you would primarily be looking at conflict/war and, (though feminist literature shows how women have participated and been affected by war) as historically men have done the fighting this theory really only analyses men's behavior in conflict completely ignoring women's behavior and perspective."
