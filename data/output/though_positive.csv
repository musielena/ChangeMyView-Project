t3_2rnr30,cni3o83,"Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one? I don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. "
t3_2rmy6e,cnhc8a5,"A lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because it's been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that we're currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhc8a5,"If no one is able to teach it, then everyone's philosophical positions will have no rigor, will make no use of the work that has already been done before. All our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees. Without rigor and background, that's where introspection gets you."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"That means things like: identifying hidden assumptions in people's reasoning, noticing informal and formal logical fallacies and generating counterexamples, identifying and isolating distinct concepts that people have mistakenly superimposed, assessing things like the knowability or provability of a claim, identifying and avoiding circular reasoning, formulating alternative possible explanations when data underdetermines the given theory and on and on. The problem with thoughtful introspection is that you're vulnerable to your own bias. It's very difficult to poke holes in your own reasoning because you always think you're right."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"You get to read arguments against other arguments and see how expert thinkers think. Obviously not, you need to study science (though you would be surprised how many leading scientists actively study philosophy). Science is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore the relationships between things in the world."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"stem cells, abortion, the policies for people in vegetative states, etc.). Likewise, most people's lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine; but, for example, cutting edge businesses (e.g. tech or service start-ups) rely on previously untested reasoning, and it can be very useful to have a capable, trained set of eyes on your thought process before you pull the trigger."

TL;DR Philosophy is like the science of reasoning, and it can be very useful when you have to reason in unfamiliar or novel ways, such as new business ideas, medical practices, and even science"
t3_2rkjr3,cngqb7p,"Say you're right, and most of the people who post here are incapable of actually changing their view on the subject they're bringing up (I don't believe this is the case most of the time, but just for the sake of argument). It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though. People have deltas awarded to them, and those signify that somewhere out there, somebodies mind was changed."
t3_2rexe3,cnf8xlt,"If business owners similarly extended military discounts too far, it could cut into their ability to be effective. On a personal level, though, I agree that ""military discount"" becoming ""public service discount"" wouldn't be a bad idea. It should be noted, however, that this would extend to even people like politicians, teachers, and government administrators"
t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"I'd say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters and do whatever without your idea's, jokes, concepts tied to any identity. Every thought stands of its own individual merits. I've been around 4chan since 2004 and the only way I would ever describe it would be chaotic neutral ."
t3_2r4b8f,cnch3ur,"How much does the ball cost? While our initial thought might be that the ball costs ten cents, this is actually incorrect. The correct answer is that the bat costs a dollar and five cents and that the ball costs five cents."
t3_2r3fa4,cnc4l6o,"Essentially your argument is that our moral obligations stem entirely from our individual beliefs. Assuming you do not believe in hell (though maybe you do, I don't know) you are claiming that even though you don't believe this place exists, you think that someone who genuinely does believe such a place exists has the moral obligation to prevent people from being sent there - even though you would say that they are mistaken that there is such a place. So my response to that is this: if someone genuinely believed that a deity had told them to kill another person (or multiple people) in order for both they and he to achieve salvation, would you argue that it is moral for them to do so?"
t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"Or in other words, it would be condemned as homosexuality, becuase you cannot change the gender that God gave you. (You can't really actually change it with science, either, but don't say that to loud, people get threatened) The single biggest reason though, is that changing your gender is in effect spitting in the face of God. If he is all knowing, and all loving, you were made the way you were for a purpose."
t3_2qtorn,cn9ejzb,"We should not cater to it. I do a little volunteer work with a women's shelter (though I'm a guy), and you will probably find that those shelters offer services for men as well. The shelter I work with has a dedicated facility for women, and partners with hotels for men."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"I did do the completionist run! I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not. It went - well, okay, I guess."
t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches. I was pissed as hell at the URL (and I don't think, as another fan, you'll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. Where an ending that's a fuck you to everything Shepard's been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepard's done."
t3_2qrbaf,cn9b6ar,"And I tried. I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot. I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time."
t3_2qqxoy,cn8oez8,"As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder. The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us wouldn't describe them as ""delusional"" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries. While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself, and in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier."
t3_2qqa7z,cn8hti0,Every exercise I can think of can be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances . Eventually though you'll stop making strength gains and simply be increasing your endurance. This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.
t3_2qmhw7,cn7hxwe,"The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public. This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex. There's this mystique and taboos surrounding it's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7h4vg,"It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure. They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous. Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it."
t3_2qia6o,cn6rxow,"I would also hope that a start up's first technical hire could be someone the founders have a reason to trust. And I see a line manager growing his team as a microcosm of a founder growing his company, though the company may have rules in place to help keep the line managers from going off the reservation. Do your rules only apply to big companies?"
t3_2qc1rl,cn4rijs,"I don't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is? Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable. Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office."
t3_2qc1rl,cn4sadr,"The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people) People thought the exact same thing before WWI. They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years."
t3_2qc1rl,cn4sadr,People thought the exact same thing before WWI. They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years. And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east.
t3_2qc1rl,cn4sadr,"It isn't some objective fact about people. J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought. The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people)"
t3_2qb4ra,cn4kqwf,"It's like playing poker with players who never bet: it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog. That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design (even though it can be unfun in some scenarios); it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy. I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades."
t3_2qaf6l,cn4h6d8,"Everyone has a mind that works in its own way. The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system. Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for ""dumb"" kids is the problem."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37lx6,Now I want to address your thesis - that the Legend of Korra devalued Korra's development as a character. Korra was a very headstrong Avatar and thought that the best way out of any situation was to punch it to death. And how does she defeat all of her enemies?
t3_2q388d,cn2re9b,"You become worse than what you are trying to eliminate. Let's have a little thought experiment: You are dragged in for 'questioning' and after you've been softened up a bit (ie. they beat you up, waterboard you, etc.)"
t3_2q0mlm,cn2s796,"Being compared with a character voiced by Kumail is a fitting reward for typing all that on my phone, but I'm also interested to know how convincing you thought my examples were. Being compared with a character voiced by Kumail is a fitting reward for typing all that on my phone, but I'm also interested to know how convincing you thought my examples were. "
t3_2pxql9,cn1q51v,"I don't think just acknowledging that the company ""would never know, or feel"" anything is sufficient to say an action is morally justified. There has to be perhaps further thought given to the principles behind why and why not that action should be taken. And yeah this issue, after that further examination, is certainly still quite morally ambiguous."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad. Still, though, Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre, and there's a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and much of the mainstream ilk out there. There have been classic Hip Hop and Rap artists awarded that kind of recognition for example URL And, you have brought up Kayne's awards and critical fame URL , which I think essentially negates your own point --- Hip Hip is getting credit, just maybe not in the way you think it deserves."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"Critical recognition is very different from public recognition, and Hip Hop has had a tough road in that respect, with a lot of negative publicity due to past gang violence, and now celebrity antics. No one, though, is arguing the worth of Hip Hop being less than any other musical genre out there, though. "
t3_2ppxgu,cmz3fxo,"4)With any circle-jerk you can assume there is a sizable portion of trolls within it. Even though they may be making fun of the ""CIS, white-penis'd, STEM wielding hivemind,"" some of them are probably those exact things. 5) While I don't have solid evidence of their ""downvote-brigading"" you have to imagine that it happens to at least a certain degree."
t3_2pnm9s,cmytc0t,"A majority of them of them were able to find employment and friendship after release. Those aren't the ones you hear about though. Odds are, in the last year, you have interacted with somebody working a job, who had previously spent over a decade in prison."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxr4yg,"Why do you think that might be? Pain is a physical and mental response to trauma although when you're feeling it pain takes on nuance. Annoying, stinging, burning, aching, wrenching, stabbing, blinding."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Think on it and let me know. Thank you although I think the argument accomplishes both. My interpretation is they're arguing for experience.
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,"You might conclude ""existentialism is a hopeful response to a hopeless world"" and that's true, but it's also true that every person cited above had something equally damning and disturbing to say about life. Yes although I can only answer based on my personal experience. I've traveled."
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,"All of those things will happen. Why worry about it though? Why allow it to prevent having experiences like mine, or someone else, or something you dream up?"
t3_2pkvb6,cmxuwcy,Yet we do. We have total agency from an existential point of view although reality does assert itself early and often. We can still do things though.

t3_2pimzj,cmx2c61,"I was specifically looking for someone to shed light on a group that I have never been personally involved with, yet had strong opinions on, because I may want my daughter to get involved. CMV is a sub where there appears to be a more cordial attitude toward debate with less impassioned mud-slinging, derision, and name calling (though I admit I have only been viewing content for a couple of weeks). It seems that if someone really wanted to get on a soapbox, they could merely head to a sub that specifically handled their topic (politics, religion, etc.)"
t3_2pf19b,cmw30ng,What's this have to do with kids? We want to encourage kids to have an expansive vocabulary so that they can adequately express themselves and convey their thoughts and feelings. Teaching a kid to swear is akin to giving the kid the trump card.
t3_2p82u7,cmudm5u,"However, you are arguing not only that moral acts must be guided by moral beliefs; you are arguing that moral acts must be guided by moral beliefs and that those beliefs must have been diligently reasoned upon. A more appropriate example would be if I were a rich businessman and wanted to help the environment because I thought it was the morally right thing to do. It turns out that I never deeply thought about if helping the environment really was morally right."
t3_2p82u7,cmudm5u,"A more appropriate example would be if I were a rich businessman and wanted to help the environment because I thought it was the morally right thing to do. It turns out that I never deeply thought about if helping the environment really was morally right. For as long as I remember, everyone said that helping the environment was morally right."
t3_2p3z06,cmt7f8t,"For instance, per the CDC regarding Flu treatment: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm No, not everything can be treated, but going in and getting antibiotics may prevent you from getting pneumonia for instance. The two situations don't overlap completely, but, clearly employers think it's worth it, even though the more their health care is used, the greater their premiums. URL that's at least similar: Honestly, I can't think of a decent search term to pull up the appropriate study, but many cases of things like pneumonia patients think they might just have bronchitis or a cough, but if a doc listens to your lungs they can diagnose pneumonia."
t3_2p3d0h,cmszlym,"As he said, he feels ""betrayed, violated, slutty."" Betrayed by someone he thought he could trust. One of his best friends molested him."
t3_2p3d0h,cmszlym,"If you can't trust your best friend, who can you trust? The rug has been ripped out from under him and what he thought he knew about friendship and trust has been shattered. Violated because his body was used in a sexual manner without his knowledge or consent."
t3_2p19c2,cmsmj84,"Ok, well, lets start with the abuses, just to prove that it is a problem that needs to be solved. Without going into it comprehensively, although it is very difficult to get complete numbers, here is a reasonable article about the number of people who are wrongfully killed by police in a year: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/ So, because there isn't great evidence, unless you have better evidence, I think it is safe to assume that this is accurate info. And that about 15% of deaths by police are abuses of some kind."
t3_2p0lop,cmsehsp,"what would 316 million people who have no idea what the first thing about monetary legislation say? do you honestly trust every single person to take the considerable time and effort to receive a proper understanding of the intricacies of monetary legislation, and then cast a well informed and welly thought out vote on it? or do you think no one will, and will instead remain ignorant and clueless, and jump on to whatever is suggested to them by mass hype (which we've established is very inconsistent and sporadic), advertising campaigns, and personal bias?"
t3_2p04r0,cms66ua,"Where was the opinion on this one? People thought he was born in Kenya, turned out he wasn't. People who think otherwise are misinformed, which is not the same as holding an opinion."
t3_2ovqav,cmr1iii,"Everyone in the ground combat elements either knows or has seen someone like this. They buy pouches for their pouches, a dozen aftermarket accessories for their weapon that they don't even use properly and spray paint those accessories in earth tones even though they roll around in a giant fucking truck you can see from a mile away. They do their level best to look like a Call of Duty cover model and just end up looking like a douchebag."
t3_2ovqav,cmramno,"Think of it this way: you would think that rugby would be a much more dangerous sport than football because rugby players don't wear pads, but that isn't the case. The NFL is having problems with concussions and TBI even though they wear helmets and facemasks, rugby players the world over don't have the same problem wearing nothing more than a scrum cap. So what gives?"
t3_2ovqav,cmramno,"Knife fights and dance offs everywhere. I conducted that training a few times at various places around the country, and what I consistently noticed was that the more access these people had to military-style gear, the more they thought that their job (being a cop) and my old job (Marine) were similar. They were the ones who wanted to ""talk firefight tactics"" with me and had the gall to ask me if I ""killed any terrorists""."
t3_2okad4,cmo23yr,"I was really fed up with all the tumblr hype and with all the people at school who were so proud to be nerd-fighters. I read TFiOS, Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, and I thought that the hype was really unfounded because they were just more formulaic teen fiction. After revisiting the books later though to see why I had (briefly) originally liked them, I decided a lot of their appeal was because they deconstructed a lot of the tropes that they're made of."

t3_2okad4,cmo8ojn,"And it's not like Hazel ran around shouting it. She reminded herself that even though life seems unfair, she can still make the most of it. It might seem weird, but that little sentence from her favorite book helped her rationalize her cancer."
t3_2oihml,cmnhr07,"In the case where the person C is unaware of the relationship between A &amp; B I would agree. However, when person C is aware of a pre-existing relationship, even though he does not directly know person B and does not therefore have a meaningful connection to ""owe"" him anything, he is disrespecting person B by knowingly facilitating person A's breach of their social contract. Person C at that point has become an accessory to the infidelity, an accomplice if you will."
t3_2o6paa,cmkar1d,"OP, I'm going to make a bold jump here, but please bear with me. Based on your starting argument, It sounds as though you understand some of the basic principles of evolution, and that you have an idea of how the scientific method works, even if you aren't yet willing to accept the conclusion that all species on Earth descended from a common ancestor. My assumption here (and please, correct me if I'm wrong) is that you are not yet willing to accept common ancestry because it directly conflicts with a core belief that you hold, which is to say that you believe that all species on Earth came to exist exactly as they are, through creation."
t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"Try to consider, however, that the people commenting on her beauty may be doing so in an effort to be compassionate. Although the situation might seem simple, there's actually quite a few factors involved that influence the response. First, does she look arrogant or attention seeking?"
t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"Call it lying or dishonesty or false hope; at the end of the day everyone benefits from a kind gesture. Although many people don't realize it, the purpose of this subreddit is to change a person's view, not necessarily reverse it. Like I said before, I agree with your points on these kinds of comments having the potential to sound condescending or blind a person from their problems."
t3_2nvj2v,cmhc9js,"Yes. Although, I still wouldn't find it practical on a large scale. The amount of resources needed to raise a pound of meat from a dog or cat is much higher than the amount needed for more common animals for consumption."
t3_2np4sw,cmfoh41,"I know full well I can come off as harsh and adversarial, even if I try not to. I thought we were both firm, while being respectful (wish I had been a bit more so myself). It's too rare on Reddit you can leave someone a robust reply, and receive a robust response, all void of personal insults and jabs, so thank you."
t3_2np4sw,cmfoh41,"You'd be absolutely right to call this ""fair"" but ... life isn't fair, and is it worth your child suffering just to be fair? I'm not even sure what the best case scenario would be here, in terms of your child's thoughts of you. Maybe you don't care because you'd be dead."
t3_2nokg9,cmftzma,"The pacifist may have longer term goals than you. They may think that even though they can reduce next weeks major violence by committing minor violence today, they may be concerned about setting a precedent of violence that will last long into the future. They may believe that their example will pave the way for a dramatic and longer lasting reduction in violence years from now."
t3_2nokg9,cmfzhbk,"So I would think by your logic we would have to acknowledge that your framework is also immoral. I don't though, because I reject the notion that imperfection implies immorality. I don't think that adequately sums up either of my second two points."

t3_2namx3,cmbzyjs,"If the police dash cam video shows you get out of the car, stumble around a bit, then puke all over the road, you're going to be convicted, no matter how good your lawyer is or how bad the prosecutor is. I can think of one example though where the issue you raise is very important. Basically anyone at the IRS or SEC who demonstrates substantial competence is immediately hired by some Wall Street law firm at 5 times their old salary."
t3_2n9vx2,cmbxdsx,"In short: you can't win this one because this sort of relative smugness is not only part of human psychology, but also one of the key essential factors that leads to the creation of daughter languages. If you didn't have people who thought ""oui"" was right and other people who thought ""si"" was right, you wouldn't have French and Spanish. (Note: simplification, the words had different forms at the time of the split.)"
t3_2n900k,cmbi11m,"I think the concept of going to start one's own nation is not analogous to changing jobs due to the amount of work required. Instead, the best option would be to change the system, since that is part of the ""contract"" I'm in with the government even though I never consented to it.

t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"I still can't bring myself to say that word without remembering those times. It went on for a while, I remember the last time though. Threatening to scream when his mum was downstairs, we were in his room and he'd locked the door."
t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"I took money from him not to tell my parents, or to let him do other things to me. It was great though, I could buy toys my parents didn't have the money to buy for me. I didn't know what prostitution was."

t3_2mv3n4,cm83yv8,"After my second relationship I was older and more confident. I'd get drunk at any opportunity and have sex with pretty much any girl I could, paid for sex several times, it didn't really help though.

t3_2muo4y,cm8kfip,"As far as piracy vs. theft, I do think that the ease of getting away with it really does have a significant impact on the frequency of piracy. My main point though is that being part of society means putting up with a lot of legislation that you don't like and that, sometimes, upholding rule of law is more important than doing what you think you should be able to, for the sake of preventing people from breaking the laws you do agree with. Civil disobedience is what you do when you are so opposed to a law that you're willing to accept the penalty for breaking it, and risk others following your example of disregard for law, rather than follow it."

t3_2m9le3,cm2e6er,"Think of your life at college as similar to solving a complex applied problem. In college, you have professors to help you get started and guide you through your thought processes, peers to share your misery with, and deadlines to make sure that you actually do the work. In the real world, you are expected to look at the problem and develop a solution with the tools you have; if your solution isn't good enough or you don't get it done on time, well, sorry, somebody else is getting paid today."
t3_2lxha7,clz4fjz,"As the article says, I agree that it's difficult for parents to make decisions about their infant's future sex life. My parents had my brother circumcised even though their doctor told them it was medically unnecessary because they were worried that my brother would feel weird in later locker room and/or sexual situations when most of his peers would also be cut, statistically speaking. I think that in matters that will have an enormous effect on a person's self-esteem, social life, emotional life, etc., it is best to wait as long as possible to allow the child to have some say in their own future."

t3_2ko5tx,cln523m,"For years, fruit juice/drinks were considered healthy and parents were shoving this stuff down their kids' throats because of this perception.

If you don't think that today's kids (who are tomorrow's adults) will be of benefit to you, go read (or watch) Children of Men - it's not great literature or cinematography, but it sure is thought-provoking. It is therefore unreasonable to claim that parents are more selfish than the childfree."

The actual rules don't really matter, though - you could make snacking harder by sticking to a ""diet"" in which you only eat foods that start with letters A-H. Counting calories and weighing everything you eat also requires that you think before you eat, but the burden is much higher than sticking to a few simple rules."

t3_2k19cr,clgz8mq,She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so.

One of the interesting things though is that, generally, lawyers do not marry fork lift operators. Doctors do not marry call center reps, etc."
t3_2joctk,cldknl1,"Antidepressents operate in different ways to psychoactives like MDMA and have very different effects. There is also a school of thoughts that when you are experiencing mental health problems like depression your brain chemistry is already out of whack, so using drugs to correct that is just like medicating any other illness. But even if we follow the idea that antidepressents 'mess' with your brain chemistry, so what?"

This brings me back to the original point."
t3_2jaiv1,cl9wvir,"Personally, I love the smell of marijuana, but that is probably due in some part to my previous use of it. One thing to note though is that as marijuana use becomes more socially acceptable and legally acceptable it will bring more innovative ways to ingest it that don't have the same smell of unburnt or burnt marijuana. Edibles and concentrates have been gaining popularity recently that don't have the typical marijuana smell, and vaporization has become a more popular way to smoke which doesn't carry the same smell either."
t3_2jaiv1,cl9wvir,Many legal growers and marijuana shop owners have essentially made marijuana their lifestyle. Do you what these people have done even though they make up the medical marijuana industry that you support? 
t3_2j7gwy,cl96wx9,"Mea culpa. Looking at your first link, OP didn't necessarily participate a lot, but every time they did participate it was to acknowledge a good point, and overall they thanked the group for providing a lot of useful ideas for clarifying what he thought (and indeed, he agreed eventually that giving to charities that supported the homeless was a better idea than giving to the homeless themselves, which is a significant change in viewpoint). I would count that one as one of CMV's successes."
t3_2j3b5u,cl82avy,We don't need to bring up every scrap of evidence for us to both know that is true. Therefore the problem partially lies with your thought patterns/behaviors/habits.

t3_2j3b5u,cl82avy,"But at the same time your knee jerk pattern of behavior is to immediately justify your purging and dress it up as logical, which I suppose helps you accept your condition without doing anything to change it (save a few visits to the doctor and a Reddit post....assumptions made on my part here).

t3_2j3b5u,cl82avy,"The first step is to want to change.

t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"So, I have nothing to say regarding your opinions - I agree that the U.S. military budget is way too high, and we could do well to implement a better health care system. One thing that's worth noting, though, is that having a military is not just as socialist as universal healthcare. Military necessarily needs to be provided for by the government, since everyone in a society benefits from having national defense yet nobody has an incentive to pay for it, so no private organization would ever be able to fill that niche."
t3_2j28la,cl81bji,"So while it'd be great if we had unlimited resources, we don't, and therefore it is a capitalistic good, and can be divided accordingly. Military defense is a fundamentally different type of public good though... "

t3_2iu5ia,cl8r2er,"so ""good"" and ""bad"" have a different context here. ""Good"" is man functioning as though he would in a state of nature, and ""bad"" is any sort of deviation from that point. It is not a representation of the social view of morality."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r2er,"and not have any sort of force acting on that exchange. This is because we not only have the right to speak, but the right to be exposed to outside ideas we don't agree with, to challenge the ones we to ( kinda paraphrasing hitchens here, but i won't be saying it as well as he did) so the ""bad"" is not the holocaust denier which many feel is bad, but the restricting of that thought to exist.

I mean more true to what republicans should be by definition of the word, as republican little ""r"" is a political philosophy and with a big ""R"" is a brand name fore a political party that is not republican or anything else other than lunacy, ""D""emocrats are also not really ""d""emocrats."

Of these three, only C seems potentially dangerous to me, although (of course) people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C. Now if A (one life-partner) is fine without C, then B must be pretty harmless without C, as well... if you do all your sexual experimentation with one partner, you are going to end up in pretty much the same place eventually, whether you start in the back seat of your parents' car or the bridal suite. Note that teenagers are immensely insecure about their romantic prowess and sexual relationships."

Fancy meals come and go, expensive electronics break or become obsolete with the passage of time, college is important, but not worth giving up a sibling for, family though, and the impression they leave on you lasts forever and is important in shaping the adult that a kid will grow up to be.

A mere comparison, though 100% different but follows the same logic, is that if police officers demand a raise and get it, then EMS workers may request one, then firefighters, etc. Government is one giant massive pot all taxes go into and then people take from - and more people want to take than want to give."

By freeing society up, by allowing people to spend less on taxes (in America, people spend 30-40% on taxes - they revolted when they paid 1-2% during a little Tea Party), one allows people to keep what they earn and demand less while sustaining themselves."

So I guess it depends on how you'd define ""rape"" -- if you include every time a woman submits to sex against her desire because of an imbalanced power dynamic in our male-centric culture, yeah, you can definitely teach that out of the culture, though granted it would be a long uphill battle. "

We don't have a mind reading device, so we can never truly know anyone's innermost thoughts, but we can get some good clues from a number of sources. As much as the conservative narrative is that this is an issue about the fetus, but not the woman's rights, a lot of the details of how conservatives approach the dialogue makes me doubt that."

So, pro-life conservatives generally have a number of objections to the applicability of the thought experiment to abortion.

You can definitely find perspectives from some of the founding fathers that support the view that the second amendment should act as a check on the government's own potential for tyranny, but that is true of pretty much everything that's in the constitution; you can consult the various founders' written views on everything and end up with a wealth of disagreement as to what purpose each article and amendment's should serve, as well as to their limits and purview."

Hence why we have a court system that exists to debate these issues since we don't have the founders around to poll for their specific thoughts on every conflict that arises. Another issue that confounds the matter is that while the second amendment protects gun ownership (at least in some sense, the extent of which has been debated for ages), the Constitution also contradictorily empowers the federal government to put down rebellions."

t3_2aymhj,cj161tw,"It's possible, in a similar way to how domesticated animals revert to something approaching wildtype when they go feral. Inserted or modified genes wouldn't be any more prone to loss or mutation than the rest of the genome, though- probably less so, since they'd been specifically designed to be advantageous. Besides, in that sort of collapse, the population in question would be very likely revert to the way they were before they acquired the characteristics you regard as dysgenic, too."

And it's not as though natural reproduction is without risks, from your point of view- that's where all these supposedly-dysgenic characters came from and how they were able to accumulate in the genome, after all.

Sorry if this is poorly written, but basically, those a three examples of countries where the government decided whether friendship, intervention, or war would be better for the country, and while the war in Iraq was a giant clusterfuck, I don't think they were wrong in believing that the most efficient way to get at their oil was to beat their government in a war."

If we can't reject absentee ownership and we continue to accept ideas like rent as being legitimate, I think the conditions would exist for a state-like entity to come about again (though it might look radically different from previous conceptions of the state, and could look completely unique from a question of formation and execution of state-policies).

Considering that second strain of thought, increased profitability may in fact increase incentives to discover, and the free market would distinguish between good discoveries and bad discoveries, the useful and the useless. However, since we are floating meaninglessly on a dying rock in a hostile universe and trying to figure out the rules to which we are hopelessly bound is basically the only meaningful affair which we can indulge in, can you not see that there is a strong counter-argument that says that it is fundamentally immoral to say ""you discovered it, and so you have the right to prevent the rest of humanity from ever knowing about what you have discovered""?"

More importantly though, the argument can always be made that ""Programme X"" should be cut so that we can spend more on Education or Healthcare. The issue with this argument is that whilst it may be true, you will not only receive diminishing returns the more you spend, but there are often very good reasons that ""Programme X"" exists in the first place."
t3_20madh,cg4ndzh,"I've already shown some of the hidden economic benefits to space research, and the LHC undoubtedly has had some as well. Why though, does the success of one impact the other? Building ten LHC's instead of the ISS would not have discovered 10 particles, and nor would building another ISS instead of the LHC (and other similar projects) grant us much more."

The problem I have with the anti-smoking lobby is that they lumped all of it in together as one dangerous mess, and pure tobacco is a lot less dangerous than cigarettes (though there is still some tar, etc.). eCigs have some of these same chemicals, but the ones that remain are no different than the ones you find eating pre-packaged food or drinking soda."
t3_20iv9v,cg3y5m7,"Allowing everyone time to fully debate the merits rather than calling a snap election (held basically as soon as the ballots could be printed) should be a prerequisite to such an election being considered legitimate. I have no problem in concept with the idea of Crimea choosing to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, although I think that they should also allow sub-regions of Crimea to secede from Crimea. I am skeptical of Russia's involvement because Russia does not allow Chechnya, Dagestan, and other disaffected regions of Russia to secede from Russia."

t3_1zyxf5,cfykpyh,"During the Cuban missile crisis, the American military leadership believed wholeheartedly that the Russians/Cubans would not respond to a military invasion of Cuba with nuclear weapons. What they didn't know at the time (but found out after the Cold War) is that the Cubans, at least, were perfectly willing to use nuclear weapons even though the Soviets were not. In short, if states are rational actors and consider material factors, Waltz is right that more nukes means less war."

I'm going to make sure that I hit them, and they stay down."

For example, there is some evidence that depression is common because it has URL , such as promoting intense, analytical thought which can help solve problems. This analytical, in-depth way of thinking is viewed by many people with depression as a positive aspect of who they are (except of course when it becomes emotionally disabling)."

t3_1yzk2r,cfpix2k,"He agreed he needed help. The doctor asked him a few questions that we hadn't thought to -- and, believe me, these were not leading questions, they were pretty much entirely out of the blue: Doctor: Are you hearing any voices? Friend: Yes."
t3_1yzk2r,cfpix2k,"We got him to the new facility, which has a fairly unique policy: They will not medicate a person against their will if at all possible. Even though he was on suicide watch (he mentioned having suicidal thoughts), so long as he wasn't actually in the act, they weren't going to force medication. He refused medication for the first day or two, and we visited him every day."
t3_1yzk2r,cfpix2k,"I mean, remember, just the day before, he could barely communicate, he was hearing voices telling him to kill, and he was physically getting into fights with security at least once a day. Now he was... a little out of it, a lot of weird thoughts to work through, but it was him again. Once he got out, it took some effort on his part and some effort on ours to make sure he kept taking his meds."
t3_1yyise,cfp1wly,"I might, however, say that living childfree is selfish toward other (existent) members of future generations. And this is why: The people I know who are choosing to live childfree are intelligent, thoughtful, influential, effective, productive people. If they had kids and raised them well, I would have every expectation that those kids would not just improve society by contributing to the gene pool, but also contribute by making good things, helping others, and leading."
t3_1yst0y,cfngu5x,"A lot of very smart guys got together and decided this wasn't really equitable for most people, especially the poor who suffered a lot due to those above them. So they thought about it and decided, by allowing everybody an education, they would be on the same footing. Which it did, for a while."
t3_1yst0y,cfngu5x,"I do think the education system has gotten off course from that purpose, and that a wider veriety of courses should be offered, including those you listed. I don't really think that that, in particular, is a cause for he current problems in society, though. Since even blue collar jobs require training and some level of education."
t3_1ysjvs,cfndapb,"I don't want to jump on semantics, but I think it's an important point - I don't find Kafka ""entertaining"". I do think he's a thought-provoking commentator on alienation, bureaucracy and existentialism. I guess I see him more as exercising or taking vitamins - I do it more for the outcome than because I enjoy it while I'm doing it."

t3_1yhd8w,cfkunw0,"But that's not always the case, and when its not, you need to be honest about how you are or aren't respecting their wishes as human beings. Okay, here's my take, broken into a few sections: Legality I don't think this is what you're talking about, but I thought I'd mention it briefly anyway.

Not every page can be a work of literary genius compact into itself, nor should it be."
t3_1ycqp3,cfjcixz,"I agree that, for example, blacks can be racist against whites, but that should just be called racism, not reverse racism. Having a different term for all the different types of racist thought only helps those that want to legitimize their own prejudices as acceptable.

t3_1yc8z3,cfj8dok,"Such codes help prevent artists from taking advantage of those whose judgment is compromised, but are not legally enforceable. It's my understanding that such a code exists, though I'm not aware of the extent to which this tenet is strictly adhered to. "
t3_1yc8x2,cfjqxyk,"It doesn't require University to hold these views. I think you should dismiss these views because they're arrived at though needs that have to do with emotion and identity and belonging, not function or experience or deliberate, focused study.

So it doesn't matter why I enjoy them, or even how much I enjoy them, really (although I happen to enjoy them a lot).

t3_1y8r7h,cfibmko,"No reasonable person would say otherwise. What I think you are getting at though, is when people judge others based on a lack of information that lead up to some marginal action. Rape and murder is objectively bad-at least most would agree-stealing a loaf of bread is simply something that can be forgiven depending on what caused a person to steal."
t3_1y8e6p,cfidj9k,"So do Mark Rothko's works. Even though many people (including myself) dislike this genre of art (personally I find it to be low effort), it's not like you can say that it doesn't fit the definition of art. Now as for all of this style of art being terrible, I think that's a very close-minded generalization."

This changed a few years later, and we now have very specific speed limits, though it still took a few years before we had a state-wide prohibition on driving with an open container of alcohol. The problem is that people tend to over-estimate the capabilities of their vehicles, as well as their driving skills."

One has the potential to hinder your sense of self more, although I know that isn't universal and many atheists have a lot of issues with this as well.

t3_1xwomv,cffjyds,"Instead, they draw you in by talking about general sociological theory without really going into detail about how it's applied or what it accomplishes. Remember also that every scientific field begins with personal opinion and conjecture; it's only upon performing the boring studies and such that it become Science with a capital S. Our understanding of gravity started when Newton (anecdotally, though not actually) had an apple fall on his head and thought ""something made that apple fall"", leading to ""I wonder if there is a force that attracts things to each other"", leading to scientific research to verify this conjecture, and now several hundred years later, we have a very refined understanding of the gravitational force.

Also, you might have noticed that I excluded the use of cellphones in this because in my experience students don't necessarily use cellphones for educational purposes in class but rather to distract themselves (even though they can be used for almost anything a tablet can be used for).

I've gotta say though I think I've just achieved a wall of text here, I totally agree in pretty much every way with your statement beyond the absolutist position of NEVER hold a belief so firm that your mind cannot be changed. I think maybe it's true of roles, a judge or doctor or politician should never rules something out completely or hold any opinions with 100% conviction, but us as simple individuals, we probably need at our core a few unshakable facts about reality that we never question because possibly that way madness lies?"

t3_1vrpkb,cev6nad,"For some people insurance is a bad decision at any price. But I believe the fact that most people buy insurance means that they have though about it, measured their risk, expected value, and aversion to that risk and decided that it makes sense to pay for that kind of insurance. If I started deciding what's best for other people I'd end up screwing them over, because I don't know them or their situations as well as they do."

t3_1voenh,ceubelw,"4. as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it."

Please note my entire comment will be pretty much based on US jurisprudence, as that is where my knowledge lies."
t3_1ud8fv,cehjb3t,"In contrast, the ""Living Constitution"" movement generally strays further from the original text, and seeks to take current conditions into account when interpreting the text. So using the ""privacy"" example from above, although the word ""privacy"" does not exist in the text of the Constitution or its Amendments, recent jurisprudence (of the last 50-75 years) has found a qualitative right of privacy protected by various provisions of the Constitution, most notably the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Ironically, the ""Living Constitution"" movement tends to think more about the intent of the Founders than the Originalists do."

It seems as though every qualm you have sited about the sport of basketball stems from the pace of the game. Every single possession in basketball must end with a missed basket, a turnover, or points all within a 24 second period; because of this fast-paced aspect of the game, the opportunities to score are greatly increased especially when taking into consideration the size of the playing field is 94' x 50', which, needless to say, doesn't even come close to the football field, baseball field, or soccer pitch."

Why is this appealing?"

Women can certainly still get pregnant, though even in the Navy it was more than a little bit recommended they choose to get an IUD to avoid this as it can, indeed, be a deep complication to their personal as well as their unit's readiness.

By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?). It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised."

Intermediate scrutiny came about during a spree of gender-based discrimination cases and has mostly been reserved for gender alone though, on some occasions, legitimacy (as in ""illegitimate"" children) as well.

t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"So the secularism of a state is in no way linked to the kinds of laws they make regarding religious freedoms (the UK and Iran are not secular states that take vastly different approaches to religious freedoms). Second, the United States is famously a secular state but it is rife with religious justification for laws (though, not regarding the right to worship). It is also institutionally Christian - the US president swears an oath on the Bible, the pledge of allegiance cites union under God and the national motto is ""In God We Trust""."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"In spite of this and it's overwhelmingly Christian population, the US has yet to bar worship of any religion. So far we see that while a given state may be officially or unofficially secular, this has no bearing on a) it's capacity or willingness to accept religious argument as a basis for legislation and b) just because a state legislates in line with a particular religion's belief's doesn't mean that it will begin to encroach on the right to worship - though the rights of non worshipers suffer, discussed below.

For example, to put it simplistically if you are analyzing states from a realist perspective you would primarily be looking at conflict/war and, (though feminist literature shows how women have participated and been affected by war) as historically men have done the fighting this theory really only analyses men's behavior in conflict completely ignoring women's behavior and perspective.

t3_304ub4,cpp5eqv,"While I acknowledge that we already do this in many places (healthcare included, for example), this does NOT mean that those laws are just or right, or that these similar situations are completely the same. For instance, I feel much better about contributing to the health insurance of someone who's mother drank while pregnant - even though as a community we are paying for someone else's mistake, the stakes are higher, and I would prefer that the person be able to live a healthy life. Furthermore, if a driver is looking for advanced protections from bad/aggressive drivers, why is it up to the government, and not the driver themselves, to provide the means to do so?"

It's very likely that even if Hank told Dale, Dale would refuse to believe Hank, think that Hank is telling a joke or not being serious, or believe in any other cognitive dissonant thoughts because as far as Dale is concerned, Nancy will never harm him.

In the modern world this cultural sense of noblesse oblige has been somewhat lost with the aristocracy, though you are well aware that those who are rich and powerful (money is power) and at the same time hugely generous (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet) do gain respect and gratitude from both the masses (their underlings) and their fellow ""nobility"" (other rich people). So no, no one can make you do anything with your money, but you can be pressured, and people can judge you, and perhaps it's actually your obligation to be a magnanimous leader, as your power in society gives you a leadership role in that society."

t3_2zow2m,cpl22pp,"Being in a relationship won't save you from feeling bad and, in fact, may even make you feel worse than if you had stayed single. It will not fix long term feelings of inadequacy or emptiness--though, yes, in the short term it can, this is simply not sustainable; those feelings will just creep back with slightly different language much like a cold virus mutated just enough to fool your antibodies. This is because, as I learned, this is not what relationships are for, it is not what they do, and it is not how they work."

In each verse, Kanye shows how damaging this obsession is, from the woman naming her daughter Alexis or a Lexus (""She couldn't afford a car/so she named her daughter Alexis""), to ""It seems we livin' the American Dream/but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem/the prettiest people do the ugliest things/for the road to riches and diamond rings"" (both an indictment of celebrity culture, and the people who emulate it), and ""we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom/we buy a lot of clothes though we don't really need 'em/things to cover up what's inside/cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth"" another assessment of culture and Kanye's experience as a black person in America (really most people's experience) of being repeatedly told by the media that we should aspire to become more thin, wear better clothes, etc. instead of work on our inner selves."

""All I want is what I can't buy now"" addresses Kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""All Falls Down"" ""We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom""). The entire fourth verse could be a darker repurposing of the ideas in ""All Falls Down"" where he laments all the struggles he still endures as a black man today despite his success like constantly being told no when he wants to buys lavish things like Benzes, cocaine, etc."

t3_2vwn9m,colkgfu,"So I don't get discriminated, unfortunately I have to begin by saying that I don't believe in Jesus and all that taboos that would disqualify me from having a voice among the completely rational and open-minded. A couple of things: First, all beliefs and most thoughts are ""emotional"". Very little, if anything, is based on empiricism and most things cannot be (most things aren't testable, repeatable, falsifiable, peer-reviewed, etc.)"
t3_2vwn9m,colkgfu,"Very little, if anything, is based on empiricism and most things cannot be (most things aren't testable, repeatable, falsifiable, peer-reviewed, etc.) and things thought to be empirical, like belief in ""logic and reason"", is known as URL There are huge bodies of work dedicated to this in neuroscience, behaviorism, and epistemology--so you can do away with the idea that some things are ""true"" on a dichotomy and realize that it's in fact a continuum that you are perceiving and not calculating or cataloging. As for your view, the reason religions are protected is twofold: (1) they're large and powerful groups capable of defending themselves, (2) they have rivalries."
t3_2vwmdb,colk97a,"Our current dog has received exactly ONE shock so far in her entire life, and this was during the final stage of training. In exchange for this ONE shock, she has been completely free in our yard her whole life, and she unfailingly respects our property line as though it were a concrete wall. She's safe from road hazards or from running away, but she runs, jumps, and explores our whole property to her heart's content."

t3_2vsa6d,cokicvr,"Not at all. In fact, this is the first time my thoughts have ever even gone in that direction so thumbs up for showing me a previously unknown perspective. :) And given that I'm bi, I would have been friends with people who think I should be a second class citizen or burn in hell."
t3_2vrkd8,cokab53,"Can you give me an example of an excusable misunderstanding? Rape is kind of specific, though. Say I decide I wanna mess up your life and I accuse you of rape."
t3_2vb7n1,cog7zan,"I sympathize a with fatigue of it after a while, given a lack of progress, lack of concrete objectives, and little that's actionable for the average person. That doesn't make him wrong or his input not valuable though. I'm unaware of demonstrably false claims."
t3_2v54ba,coekrjt,"First, most Christians do not hold the OT in anything close to being the ""last word"" on moral issues. They aren't eating shellfish and wearing mixed fabrics because they're hypocrites, they're doing those things because the OT isn't the basis of Christian moral thought. Second, you may well be surprised what the majority of Christians believe on any particular issue."
t3_2v54ba,coeiz64,"And once you see that religion doesn't entail a literal reading of that religion's scripture, it seems most of your objection disapears. Because the ""regressive views"" of the religion that you see religion entailing are not necessarily part of the religion (though, again, they are part of the religion for many people). "
t3_2uyf2j,cocy4sv,"The school is interessted in making their pupils into functioning members of society, they don't teach you math so you can solve these very specific equations you learn during highschool, they want you to understand the greater logic behind it. The same goes for sport, the school isn't interessted in teaching you how to play soccer just for the sake of it or because they want to make you into a star soccer player, but it has other benefits too: - People who are doing sport are generaly fitter than those who don't, that doesn't only decrease obesity but also makes for better students overall - People who attend sports regularly without being forced to (like they are when attending schools) will learn to form habits and stick to them when they are benefitial, even though its uncomfortable from time to time (For example when its raining outside, you really aren't in the mood for it or something like that) you are not giving up as easily - You learn things like teamwork or the ability to make quick decisions or overall skills that are usefull when playing sports, but are also usefull somewhere else - The social factors is also pretty huge, the school doesn't want 1000 students who are foreign to one another, its generally better for everyone when students are binding, sport is excellent for that "
t3_2uyc2l,codgr1k,"We were taught how to apply dental dams and female condoms. We talked about masturbation, and even about sex toys, although without much detail. No one of these things was emphasized more than the other, which made all of them equally ""normal"" or ""acceptable""."
t3_2uyc2l,codgr1k,"I feel like this succeeded for two reasons: Teenagers are smart, and if you try and tell them how to run their lives they'll stop listening to you. If any of these people had told me sexual experimentation is good for me, I would have reacted as though I had just been told abstinence is good for me - namely, ""you don't know what's good for me"". Which is, I believe, the correct reaction."
t3_2uudze,cobt14z,"Lack of variations in levels or items(4 colors of tiles, a few simple bonus tiles or powerups). * Very often they require a lack of in-depth thought or strategy(or they break down the pieces to solving a more complex puzzle into very small and simple steps that are easy to advance). * Static backgrounds or very limited interactivity with the environment, or no environment at all."

t3_2unhtm,coaivyc,"The fact that the fetus can't sustain its own life until seven months old isn't part of the equation for them - it's a question of ethics. They contend that although the fetus relies on the mother completely in order to grow into a child, it is equally ethically abhorrent to terminate the life in its gestation period as it is to terminate it after it has been born. The reason they refuse to accept non-life threatening reasons as valid grounds for an abortion is because they view the process as putting economic/emotional/etc strain over the value of a human life."
t3_2ujo2u,co94irv,"And that depends on how bad the crimes you are complicit in are. Even though my family would not be broke if we moved to Canada or Switzerland, I don't think the crimes the US is committing are bad enough to justify leaving the country. One day they could be, and if that day comes I will leave."
t3_2uj4yv,co9ncgk,"Petty inter-state power squabbles happen all the time, and healthcare is not something I'm comfortable with them dragging into that muck. Education: This definitely meets the constitutional challenge for federal control, though it does admittedly rely on SCOTUS principles. Having an educated populace is a compelling government interest."
t3_2uh710,co8twl0,"We'll just take for granted that there's a lot more ""monthly bills"" today than there were in decades past. Cable and smartphones didn't exist in the 1960's (though I think you're discounting how many subscription services used to be necessary that technology has eliminated. No one gets delivered blocks of ice to their ice box anymore, for example) But let's look at URL ."
t3_2ug2wi,co834v1,"Just because the matter is eternal does not mean that that exact arrangement of it is (e.g. entropy), though you mention infinities at some point, which segues into my next point. I will grant you that there are prevailing theories about the infinite nature of the universe and how that can lead to exact duplicates of structures in the universe, and therefore exact copies of yourself."
t3_2ug2wi,co834v1,"However, you run into a much deeper philosophical barrier when trying to consider this. The though experiment as I know it is called the 'Ship of Theseus' or the 'Theseus Paradox', and it describes a ship which has been preserved through time by replacing each rotting bit of wood with a new piece of wood. You take the ship, replace plank by plank, at what point is that ship no longer the same ship?"
t3_2ug2wi,co82vuw,"Even if those hypotheses exist, they have no empirical evidence backing them up and so this ""infinite consciousness"" has no basis in reality. This might be news to me but I thought the prevailing hypothesis is that the universe will just keep expanding (Big Freeze?). I have no idea where a new universe will be formed from ours."
t3_2ucr50,co7790p,"Though it seems your perception isn't really about watches, but instead that 'fashion' as a whole is stupid. I mean, I agree that that an obsession with or spending beyond ones means on fashion is dumb... but beyond that I don't see what the issue with putting a little bit of thought into how one presents oneself. I don't understand where the line is you're drawing with fashion."
t3_2u9e12,co6da0r,"Japan isn't massively reliant on American trade, so this would hurt the US more than it would hurt Japan, and thus they would likely just call the US's bluff. Although the US is a more important trade partner to Japan than Japan is to the US, Japan mostly imports fairly undifferentiated products from the US, like refined petroleum products, industrial minerals and chemicals and beef. These could easily be bought elsewhere."

t3_2u3ogv,co4z22h,"You'll need lower-fat, lower-sodium foods for the rest of the day to offset a burger like that. Something being labeled or thought of an ""unhealthy"" doesn't mean one can never eat it without having a heart attack. It just means that that food is particularly suboptimal for wellbeing."
t3_2tuej1,co2lkqr,"As for your definition, based on your responses to other people, there isn't a lot of wiggle room there. Can you give us some thoughts on what it would take to change your view? What would we need to prove?"
t3_2tuej1,co2lkqr,"If I read some idiotic claim on reddit (I know, unlikely, but stay with me here) and instead of blindly accepting it, I look for the source, read the paper it quotes, consider the methodology used and the potential flaws, that is acting in a scientific manner. If my kid asks whether x or y will freeze sooner, and we devise an experiment to test it, that's doing science, even though no one would publish a paper on the relative freezing points of Tang vs OJ. I know your concern is that it cheapens the word ""scientist"" when these schlubs get lumped in with hardcore research scientists like you and your colleagues."
t3_2tuej1,co2pqwp,Merriam Webster is the only one that supports your more limited definition. I thought it was interesting to see that the 1913 definition was considerably less restrictive. The point is that people consider him a scientist.
t3_2tpl0x,co1enmk,This line of argument only counters a specific point made about a pro for the school in the article you referenced. Pointing out that it isn't a good argument doesn't constitute an argument against the school though? So what if kids with crappy parents they know won't accept them won't be able to attend?

t3_2tiipu,cnzc4fs,"Sure, it's safe so long as it stays the size it is and you don't get too close, noting to worry about really. The moment it gets big enough to break the leash, though, or the moment you let your guard down when feeding it, it's going to take a chunk out of you with no hesitation whatsoever. There are some cases where that kind of thing isn't a huge problem, because the stakes or consequences are relatively low."
t3_2tekkp,cnyd3k9,"There are limits to this- I'd agree that Germans shouldn't be killed in retaliation for Hitler, and I'd agree that Americans shouldn't be killed for screwing with the middle east. That said though, there are degrees of collective responsibility. If the people of a country allow things to be done in their name by their government, then they do deserve some level of responsibility for those actions."
t3_2tct9j,cny4adc,"You're never (or _rarely_) going to disagree with your own vote. Nobody will dispute that Congress _can_ act (though recently, I don't think many would dispute that they're not) - the real disputation with FPTP is that it unnecessarily forces people to vote for things they _don't_ believe. Compromise is equally possible with a non-FPTP system, but that compromise will be more representative of what individuals believe than what the party platform believes."
t3_2t8798,cnwofae,Both of which I think are hard for an average person to really comprehend and understand. I'll agree though that there are obviously things that the military doesn't need and it's pretty easy to point out waste. But you or I just aren't in a position to really know the justifications around a lot of stuff that happens.
t3_2t5d0k,cnw2fgz,"How else would it be such a hit? The point of it, though, is that even the villains are humans, who did this for a reason other than ""they're monsters"", and might not have done it (or, more importantly, might stop doing it) if it seemed like anyone cared. Remember that sociopathy is not the norm."
t3_2stah2,cnsnfp3,"We stomp on roaches and swat flies. They have thought. So when you step back and look at it, it's less of a cut and dry situation and more of a greyscale."
t3_2sqh6c,cnsh391,"Most traditional cultures persist over the centuries because they inculcate a bigoted, intolerant attitude in their members that makes them treat reform as treason. One point to clarify: your cultural criticism can not only be thoughtful and in good faith and non-racist, but also true and important , but nonetheless it can still make you an asshole. This is because asshole is not an observer-independent term."
t3_2sf2we,cnp48f2,"I was worried I had health issues or that something was wrong. Something was wrong, though. I wasn't attracted to who I was with."
t3_2sbnxo,cno79au,"What issues you usually have with white actors playing roles of different races is a mixture of the widespread social stigmas because of past-wrong doings, as well as the often stereotypical portrayal which could've been better done by someone who is actually of that race. I would ask, though, for you to explain better why you think that both the impracticality doesn't matter, and why you find it offensive? If an actor can bring someone disabled to life on the screen and give a really faithful and convincing performance with due respect given to the disabilities that person has, what is there to be offended by who portrays that character?"
t3_2sbnxo,cno8skh,"So again... unless the performance itself is a mockery, why would it be offensive? Isn't that what all acting is though? ""Well done, you fooled us into thinking you were part of the greatest romance ever known that befell tragedy on the Titanic"", ""Well done, you fooled us into thinking you were a slightly mad rogue pirate fighting zombie pirates with coins"", ""Well done, you fooled us into thinking you were a 2 foot tall person with a quest to save a mystical world from a ring of doom""."
t3_2sbnxo,cno8skh,"If someone like Eddie Redmayne, Daniel Radcliffe, or Benedict Cumberbatch was cast to play the role, you know its because the directors are confident that those actors are very talented in that art, and will do their best to become the person they're trying to project. But back to the practicality, because I really think that's something you haven't thought all the way through... it depends on the kind of disability you're talking about. In the case of Stephen Hawking, he has transformed wildly over the course of his life in terms of appearance because of his condition."
t3_2s311o,cnlr4r5,"But everyone's voice gets to be heard. Although I'm not an advocate of religion in public schools, which seems to be what you're actually against as opposed to people complaining about public schools in general, I certainly think every tax payer has a right to levy their concerns and desires for public school. To say citizens who are paying for a program through taxes and fees have no right to make demands as to how it should be run would be endorsing a dictatorship."
t3_2s04yv,cnl68x9,"Solamente son mis dos centavos. I've actually been thinking about this a lot, although I identify as Mexican American so I guess I this may not apply to African Americans.
