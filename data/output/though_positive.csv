t3_1h5k81,t3_1h5k81,"It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised."

t3_1er14x,t3_1er14x,"The idea of jailing a rape victim for an abortion is abhorrent to many people, though, so the pro-life movement mostly does not seem to demand ideological consistency on this point (which is fine with me, since I'm pro-choice anyway)."

t3_2y2tk3,t3_2y2tk3,People use the Ferguson riots (which weren't about general issues of race but were instead mounted as though they were about a single white police officer wrongfully killing an unarmed black man who was trying to surrender) as the basis to judge the entire ongoing civil rights discussion America needs to be having.

t3_2y1nt3,t3_2y1nt3,"You want to learn a store of background knowledge (like the organization of your operating system) by heart, because even though you could learn the answer to any specific question with a search engine, even fairly basic investigations are complex, unwieldy, and unreliable until you have enough background knowledge to streamline the search down to the more challenging questions."
t3_2xzpg1,t3_2xzpg1,"I just recently learned they write in depth articles, but because they have so many listicles I don't trust that the article I'm clicking on will go in depth even though I've read an in-depth article from them."

t3_2x854p,t3_2x854p,"""All I want is what I can't buy now"" addresses Kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""All Falls Down"" ""We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom"")."
