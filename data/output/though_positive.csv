t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,The problem with thoughtful introspection is that you're vulnerable to your own bias.

t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"Likewise, most people's lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine; but, for example, cutting edge businesses (e.g."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhjqws,"tech or service start-ups) rely on previously untested reasoning, and it can be very useful to have a capable, trained set of eyes on your thought process before you pull the trigger."

t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"(You can't really actually change it with science, either, but don't say that to loud, people get threatened) The single biggest reason though, is that changing your gender is in effect spitting in the face of God."

t3_2qslmz,cn96gyu,"I was pissed as hell at the URL (and I don't think, as another fan, you'll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense."

 Subatomic physics, which is arguably an example of science moving beyond strict empiricism and into new epistemological territory (I say arguable because I wouldn't agree with it but the fact that the argument even makes sense to have is relevant and important) * Democratic socialism, which is an area of political thought that meaningfully approaches the criticisms of strict capitalism that Marx raised, without falling into the serious shortcomings that come with a modernist interpretation of socialism Furthermore, achievements like the internet -- or, to get more specific, Wikipedia -- represent accomplishments in the human organization of knowledge that were literally unthinkable during the enlightenment."

t3_2j7gwy,cl96wx9,"Looking at your first link, OP didn't necessarily participate a lot, but every time they did participate it was to acknowledge a good point, and overall they thanked the group for providing a lot of useful ideas for clarifying what he thought (and indeed, he agreed eventually that giving to charities that supported the homeless was a better idea than giving to the homeless themselves, which is a significant change in viewpoint)."

t3_2fuvyn,ckd2th4,"Of these three, only C seems potentially dangerous to me, although (of course) people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C.

t3_29thke,ciod9wn,"In the real world though, there are some issues... 1."
t3_29pjwk,cincqfj,"the problem here is a simple one of equivocation the primary issue is that ""authority"" in the common sense consists of people who have the capability to lie induction is based on independently confirmed observations over the course of as many trials as possible so far, we pretty much know that gravity is gravity because so far, while on the ground on planet earth, we have not observed an apple falling up a person who is considered an ""authority"" can say he's seen an apple falling up, and that's quite a different matter than whether or not apples actually fall up on a regular basis and that this fact could be independently observed and confirmed by multiple parties in multiple trials across the planet while it's entirely possible that one person may lie about apples falling up, it becomes (usually) increasingly more and more unlikely that people are lying when multiple independent sources attempt and observe the same phenomena when subject to a panel of people (peer review) who usually by and large would like nothing more than to prove someone else wrong science is self correcting... when ""I tried it a thousand times at a hundred spots across the globe and so far apples don't fall up, so I think you're full of shit"" is the response that comes from dozens or hundreds of different people, you can be fairly (although of course not 100%) assured that apples do not fall up and that gravity behaves as we more or less expect of course you are free to believe that apples fall up based on the evidence that there is a logical fallacy known as the appeal to authority and that you are effectively taking these people's word on the situation and so hundreds of people may be involved in a mass conspiracy to delude you - but I'd pretty much say that's at the very least counter productive, and at the worst kind of stupid in fact you are welcome to try your own experiments to let go of apples and see how many of them fall upwards (pending approval of funding of course), but my guess is that you will observe that they do not fall up and that if you do observe that they fall up there is one of several explanations, either you may have indeed found an anomaly (the least likely) or you are on drugs, or you simply have confirmation bias - and confirmation bias is a primary reason that things like peer review exist, because a person like yourself might not believe the status quo and may wish to try for themselves, and you are welcome to do so, and if you can provide a way for other people to also challenge the theory as you did, and also do the thing, and also see the same results, then maybe you've found an anomaly otherwise you're just crazy - of course you may simply be narcissistic and think that other people are not real or some such other oddity and so their challenges and retesting of the experiments don't count because they're all out to pull the wool over your eyes, but that would basically be psychosis if I've got my terms correct, and you would in that case be suffering from an equally problematic situation in which you think you are, but you are not, an authority"
t3_29pjwk,cind88i,"well, you have to draw the line somewhere, it's not appeal to authority in the same sense or in anywhere near the same capacity that ""appeal to authority"" as a logical fallacy is meant to be understood ""appeal to authority"" is more along the lines of ""bob is a mechanic and he says I need new blinker fluid"" - wheras inductive reasoning is more along the lines of ""thousands of scientists, myself included, have attempted this well documented and replicable experiement procedure and most of us, but not all have observed the same results"" pick your side, pick your battles - just because 1% of people saw apples fall up, even if they really aren't lying, doesn't mean that really changes the fundamental fact that most of the time you and everyone else notice that apples generally fall down you can't completely eliminate cognitive bias, but with the scientific method we can get about as close as possible to doing so and about as close as possible to a present time understanding of the truth having beliefs, that are based on the best available current evidence, that are open to change when presented with compelling new evidence, is about as much as you can do if you want to call that appeal to authority, then ok, but you've gotta draw the line somewhere as to who to believe and when, and peer reviewed science, though not infallible, is about as close to the best option a person has"

t3_1hxjqk,cayxqwq,"Great solution in my opinion (not really applicable for women, though)."
t3_1hv4rd,caybwrp,There's no reason that these things can't happen again - the Romans and Soviets probably all thought that they were well-prepared enough to prevent a collapse.
t3_1hv4rd,caybwrp,I think one thing that people talking about collapse do themselves a disservice with is their word choice though.
t3_1hv4rd,cazpmxq,"I have no idea how likely it is that either of these things change though - not so much because of the strength of the dollar, but simply because every other currency seems to have the same problems."
t3_1hv4rd,cazsg9p,"This will make things get steadily more expensive over time - which if you think about it you've probably seen in your lifetime (lately though the trend hasn't been to raise the amount on the price tag of basic goods, but to sell a smaller amount for the same price)."

t3_1hf3eh,catuwc7,Corporations will always wield less dangerous power (though sometimes only slightly less dangerous) and will always minimize distributed decision making as it is antithetical to the goal of maximal efficiency.

t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?)."
t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised."
t3_1h5bo4,car3t1w,"Gender, on the other hand, only warrants intermediate scrutiny, though it has gotten to the point in some cases where it's closer to strict than anything."

t3_1gjtcs,cal0tb3,"Star Trek's writers (or Roddenberry, specifically), thought that--out of the millions of rules we make exceptions to every day--there might be some which deal with such a huge risk that it's better to make the rule absolute rather than dabble with discretion."

t3_1ghg9u,cakhjuz,"I admit I don't know as much about the history of the Koran as I should, but for the bible, it is fairly easy to explain why - all the books were written by different people, and though divinely inspired, they simply didn't cross-check everything to make sure the points were the same."

t3_1fm8eb,cabxdab,I totally agree though.
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"Second, the United States is famously a secular state but it is rife with religious justification for laws (though, not regarding the right to worship)."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"So far we see that while a given state may be officially or unofficially secular, this has no bearing on a) it's capacity or willingness to accept religious argument as a basis for legislation and b) just because a state legislates in line with a particular religion's belief's doesn't mean that it will begin to encroach on the right to worship - though the rights of non worshipers suffer, discussed below."
t3_1fl5d8,cabci41,"It is your contention that in some sense Mendel was not 'honest' to other scientists because his groundbreaking work on genetics was carried out in a church, although quite what you believe a scientist must do to be 'honest' is not made clear - in the scientific method it literally doesn't matter whether the results you publish come to you in an LSD-induced hallucination as long as they are replicable by others, so how can it possibly matter whether your beliefs are coherent?"

t3_1f5j5p,ca7188z,"Whether or not gender queer is recognized (and I'm friends with many people who'd sooner die than admit I'm not an ordinary straight male, even though I've experiences in life that make it easier for me to talk to women and the LGBT community, than to other straight men), it exists, as itself."
t3_1f3esr,ca6fmh9,"That's not going to get many people involved, though."

t3_1enop4,ca26n3f,"So as you can see feminists have uncovered gender biases in structures once thought neutral or just the natural order of things, in doing so it has been necessary to examine masculinity, as well as femininity."
