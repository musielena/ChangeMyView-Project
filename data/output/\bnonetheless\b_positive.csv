On a regular basis, I see criminal defendants accused of a crime where they have a very slim or weak defense (but a defense nonetheless) agree to 20 year plea bargains rather than face a life sentence if convicted at trial. These are almost uniformly guys who have been to prison before."

Same rules apply if the feds or your state lower their respective estate tax levels."
t3_2jpazx,cldtopl,"You are advocating a lie of omission. It is in the interest of good taste, sure, but it is a lie nonetheless.

t3_2il5rb,cl34j8r,"When I'm at the beach the only shelter between my privates and the passing onlookers is a flimsy pair of swimming trunks.

t3_20ndjd,cg4z9hs,"I'd be willing to bet that you personally know at least one religious person who regularly behaves in a way that you would call immoral, and at least one non-religious person who lives according to strict moral guidelines. I can't expect you to take my word for it, but I'd nonetheless like to report that I've met many people who fall into both of those categories. In light of that evidence, doesn't it seem likely that a person's tendency to behave morally can have to do with something other than his or her religious beliefs?"

Unfortunately in practice, she often doesn't have the ability or means to pursue that reduced sentence, but the constructs of the legal system do nonetheless technically currently provide it for her. All this being said--I do still want to change your view."
t3_1z1x25,cfps3jr,"I don't really like reddit's cavalier attitude about how it sometimes gives these views room to grow, but I can see the flip side of this argument and the ways in which it might be better to keep them out in the open and subject to heavy criticism rather than moving underground and pretending these issues don't exist anymore. They might not exist, like us, to probe at those ideas but they can feed into that function nonetheless. "
t3_1uhj8f,cei5r73,"Yet many people in philosophy of mind still don't think it is likely to be true. Here is an illustration why: even though it seems too surprising, too incomprehensible that other hunks of meat in other human heads could give rise to conscious thought, that surprising-ness is just as real with regards to the hunks of meat in our own heads, and yet we have first-person direct acquaintance with our conscious experience nonetheless.

t3_1ktrbd,cbsiyod,"Only body autonomy properly explains the reason why this woman should be able to have an abortion. Similar scenarios exist when women on birth-control nonetheless become pregnant, or when a man claims to be sterile, or to have had a vasectomy, but either is not or didn't.

t3_316pae,cpyz7yp,"The overall health of the economy is hard to measure, but generally speaking, the US finds it far easier to jump-start its economy after economic crises because it doesn't face legislative roadblocks or sticky benefits in any way at all close to how big these problems are in the EU.

But nonetheless , there is no one else who is hurting the victims worse that you are by choosing B, and their suffering is significant, so again: to anyone who cares about the suffering of the victims of B at all, you must either participate in a collective action solution to help the victims, or you are intentionally and unapologetically harming them. Would you agree with this description of the two abstract cases?"
