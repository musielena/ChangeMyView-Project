t3_2opfa2,cmpbzl7,"Because everyone has holidays but not everyone is Christian? ""Happy Holidays"" is an inclusive greeting whereas ""Merry Christmas"" isn't necessary so. Promoting the Christian facet of what has become a secular holiday does (to an extent) exclude non-Christians."

t3_2mptvb,cm6q0wq,"I think there are usually much more factors at play that all get grouped in a ""nice"" or jerk/pary person"" category. I can tell you why I wouldn't be attracted to you at that point, that has nothing to do with niceness and whereas I am pretty repulsed by ""alpha"" qualities (I don't like dominant men, arrogant men etc.) Being nice just means that, being nice."
t3_2lo786,clwwic8,"With many people performing the same monologue, it's fascinating to watch how some absolutely make it come to life (without lights, directors, etc) while some end up just reciting lines. I wouldn't think of it as everyone is a good actor; rather, with good actors, the script/directing/cinematography serve to ENHANCE their acting, whereas with only competent actors those elements serve to MAKE UP FOR their decent acting. A great actor could do what he does without the help of all these things, whereas a bad one needs those things to make the film seem good."

t3_2l6s0m,cls5hqx,"The reason climate scientists have tried to expunge global warming from colloquial usage is that people tend to misunderstand that term. It only refers to the global heat content, whereas everyone assumes it means it will just get hotter everywhere. But there are definitely examples where certain areas have the potential to get colder."
t3_2kgrtb,cll7z9y,"If you are managing your calories, these programs may make it easier. Many of them provide packaged meals and plans to keep you on track, whereas managing calories manually can be more time consuming. This has nothing to do with changing your view, but one of the best ways to lose weight is by drinking water ."

t3_2k49mm,clhupbu,"It may have the effect of getting them to improve their writing skills, but most likely it will just discourage the person from communicating at all in the future. Being nice while correcting someone would be a better and more effective way to get to the end result you seem to want, whereas being a jerk about it could be helping to exacerbate the problem. "
t3_2i0v1l,ckyf89q,"Your story moved me and there are a few things I wish to say: 1) Money is not equal to time at all. In fact, time is of nearly infinite value whereas money is something that comes and goes. A human being is in fact composed of time: by that I mean that it's the only resource you really have, and that once it's gone, it can never, ever be replenished."
t3_2hevmr,cks21ow,"Ideally, an egalitarian society would start everyone on the same footing per se, but that does not involve what you're assigning to it. Background would definitely be accounted for, whereas genetic discrepancies would not, at least not in the manner you seem to imply. As in the footrace analogy, the speed at which someone runs the course, and the obstacles they are able to overcome, are dependent on them, and are not intended to be normalized."
t3_2gutfw,ckmsmic,"Also, George Zimmerman is a special case in that his ""Whiteness"" (i.e. his name) came across in print whereas his ""Hispanicness"" didn't. Keep in mind that the media didn't release pictures of him right away because the media firestorm actually only occurred some time after Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin."
t3_2f8s0s,ck7ja0r,"One could make the argument that government-based police and military are necessary for the well-being of society. In other words, the argument would be that taxing for police/military/courts provides a clear benefit which far outweighs any potential harm, whereas taxing for welfare doesn't -- (or at least there seems to be lots of reasonable debate about the efficacy of welfare, whereas there doesn't seem to be nearly as much reasonable debate about fully privatized police/rights-enforcement/military etc.) That said, I do think you are on to something."
t3_2d8gej,cjnvled,"As far as we know, as our marginal happiness increases, our tolerance for happiness also increases (downward-sticky, if you will). What I mean by this is that for a person living in the first world, something like three meals a day does not cause happiness, whereas for a person living in the third world it would. However, as the person in the third world becomes accustomed to having three meals a day, their happiness tolerance is increased, and they no longer feel happiness from this event."
t3_2bqtzl,cj810fl,"Unlike Ray Rice's attack on his then-fiancee, Josh Gordon's offense was victimless. The crimes that Ray Rice committed would result in real jail time for the average American, whereas Josh Gordon's ""crime"" wouldn't incur such harsh penalties. If the NFL claimed to leave the policing to the authorities, a mere two-game suspension would be enough to make a statement."
t3_2atya5,ciyug3x,"I'm a perfectly attractive person, but I'll never look like Anne Hathaway (or whoever). What's more, even a little bit of manliness reads as ""man"" whereas men can get away with a lot of little feminine quirks. If you don't believe me, look at the difference between how easily trans men and trans women ""pass""."
t3_26i4op,chraus0,"There is a limit to how much of a return you can get, people tend to get stuck in ruts without breaks of fresh information. To me, use of qualifiers show your understanding of confidence, whereas a lack of them indicates over or unfounded confidence. There seems to be an emotional attachment to ""put yourself on the line"" so to speak in some people's views but generally these people tend to speak without thinking."
t3_24c1q3,ch63wru,"It seems to me like you think fetish is a bad word. You have some ""real"" fetishes, which I'm guessing are things you'd be embarrassed to admit, whereas you think that liking hair is natural, so it's not a ""fetish"". The reality is, you clearly have a fetish for pubic hair, since it increases your enjoyment of sex more than it would for a ""normal"" person in your age group (it's a preference that runs counter to the common desires of your age group)."
t3_21h3ct,cgcysnd,"In the latter, it's potentially at the hands of an individual. The difference is that individuals are necessarily diffused power whereas the state has a concentrated arsenal of prosecutorial resources to launch at you once accused. When we say 'better to let 10 guilty men go free,' what we're basically saying is that it's a lot easier (and tempting) for the government to wrong more people on a daily basis because of the power it has and we want to focus on preventing that rather than creating general rules based on speculative possibilities of a single person harming other people."
t3_1zrq6d,cfwexd1,"Consequently, a university would be able to publish many more articles. Even if a university finds itself short on funds, it can still choose to subsidize the cost of publishing for its faculty, whereas under the current subscription system, the university would be forced to choose which journal subscriptions to drop. Also, with open access journals such as PLoS One, the decision to accept or reject a manuscript is made before the journal requests its publication fee."
t3_1yqbtv,cfn3a9g,"It's not a real word, yet my wife gets the idea. What I'm getting at is that, whereas words and proper usage are tools to communicate an idea, the idea doesn't care what words are used so long as it gets to the audience unchanged. Saying ""that's just semantics"" is to place all attention on the words at the expense of the idea."
t3_1xvch2,cfeznzr,"The first meeting between them at the university where Holmes was beating a corpse to learn about post mortem bruise development was almost word for word how it happens in the book, right down to the way Holmes analyzed Watson on the spot. The only difference between the show and the books was that in the books Holmes deduced a number of things from his pocket watch, whereas in the show it was his phone. And the Characters in the show are, in my opinion, the best representation of the characters as they appear in the book I have ever seen."
t3_1xp9br,cfdd9ab,"If you are an arrogant ass, nothing feels better. Another point then, I think confident people surround themselves with other confident people to create a healthy network of support, whereas arrogant people surround themselves by insecure people in order to make themselves feel better. "
t3_1xp9br,cfddgkk,"Then I guess I would also tie in being ignorant with being arrogant. And if a confident person is wrong, they can accept being wrong, whereas an arrogant person would hate being wrong about the topic and then revert to personal attacks. "
t3_1t3wf5,ce44afm,"They use models, principles, and the empirical method - but they are far from becoming subfields of physics. For this reason, a biologist studies biology whereas someone studying ""biological science"" is doing studies on something related to biology. Like you, my specific computer science program focused primarily on algorithms - few classes needed an actual computer."
t3_1okrb7,ccswjh5,"'Indoctrination' is a word that really just means 'education' but of course with very negative connotations. And whereas I fully agree that teaching children about religion is a very bad thing (as I believe that religion spreads some profound untruths about the nature of the universe) - I think everyone has the right to teach their children whatever they think is true. So whereas I wish religious parents were more informed, they have the right to be wrong about something, and indeed spread their misinformation to others - just as anyone else does."

I don't see how this ""proves religions are lies""."
t3_1mqfmi,ccbqtty,"However, I think there's a pretty strong case that the 1 $100k earner is far more valuable to the economy in the long run than the $10k earners are. The difference is that eventually that $100k person will accumulate some wealth, whereas the $10k people will not. And having some wealth accumulations in the economy is absolutely necessary for it to grow, because that's the only way that we ever invest in new technologies and production."
t3_1l8ss8,cbx7nzh,"But it is not a disease like schizophrenia. A mental disorder has tested causes and treatments, whereas transgenderism, while it has a known way to make your physical gender match your mental gender, has no cause, and certainly no treatment. There is no way to ""fix"" your mental gender."
t3_1kcow1,cbnmff3,per their citation of 25 years). Maybe everything I said above is more descriptive of 1790-1835 whereas afterward slavery became more and more of a primary issue until it exploded. Does that sound like a good model?
t3_1jzymk,cbk02iw,"More women than men now graduate college, true. Does that point to a change in the education system that favors women, or does it point to men being complacent when it comes to further education whereas women are becoming more active? A lot of girls who are currently starting their careers have grown up hearing ""girls can do whatever boys can do"" and realizing that they might have to work harder to get there."
t3_1i6m7q,cb1p75z,"2) Students progress is not (smoothly) randomly distributed, but rather forms a normal curve. The vast bulk of students will actually progress at a fairly typical pace, whereas only a few will significantly lag behind or speed ahead. The consequence of this is that at any given part of a (calendar) year, the relative sizes of the various classes are going to be very unbalanced."
t3_1hqnv9,cawxgns,"With battery you would not be forced to confront it in your normal, everyday life once the abuser is removed from your life. I think what makes rape worse than say battery is that rape takes something that is good - sexual intimacy, and turns it into something evil, whereas battery is an evil thing in itself. What I mean is that if a person is raped it will often make any subsequent sexual experience, even with someone they love and who loves them, much more difficult because many rape victims have a very difficult time forgetting what happened to them and are forced to confront it every time they have sex."
t3_1h9ldb,cas7mja,"If a woman has sex she is considered a slut and is unclean, while the virgin is considered a prude and as seen as losing some of femininity. This is especially true of women in politics, whereas commentators will comment on what a female politicians wear (shoulder-pads for Hilary Clinton and the the style of Sarah Palin) this is rare commentary for male politicians. The only instance I can think of are the many jokes about John Boehner's tanning."
t3_1fafn1,ca8c6l7,"Even if you (somehow) construct a situation where society at large has equal participation in both means and ends, there is still a temporal argument to be made; i.e. valuation of ""means"" evolve with a society and are frequently tested and refined, whereas ""ends"" are by definition a single data point -- a single decision. Saying ends over means is equivalent to saying personal gain over social morals, which is a rejection of the social contract."
t3_1ekr96,ca1bmet,"This is the assumption that would have to change in order to change your view. The reason you should change it is that the world and all its philosophical and political movements are large, but they are less meaningful than an individual because an individual is sentient, whereas movements are not. If you think I am overemphasizing the importance of sentience, I would counter that our awareness of things is the only way we know that anything is or can be meaningful."
t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"It's unfair to claim things like principia mathematica, or ZFC, or Godel's incompleteness theorem, as part of philosophy! To me they are clearly mathematics (but that's probably because I'm studying mathematics whereas you're studying philosophy). People like Russell and Whitehead can hardly be classified as philosophers ""just using mathematics"" like an engineer uses a calculator."
t3_1edqbg,c9zdwam,"They will have access to the genes and the know-how and have the benefit of the reputation of people who have provably succeeded before. If they are born with deformities, their parents will be able to pay the best doctors to fix them, whereas a kid who didn't have such advantages may be unable to afford such care. They will have any number of advantages not everyone will have."

t3_1duzzk,c9uc531,"It's not just tax evasion that is the problem. Middle and lower class families typically put most of their wealth in their home, whereas wealthy families typically have a good portion of their wealth in liquid assets (stocks, retirement plans, etc.) Middle and lower class parents will have to jointly own their houses with their kids, to make sure that the kids aren't homeless if the kids die."
t3_1bp6uw,c994sb5,"In that way I think Reddit is far from perfect, but I do like this site much more than any other forum I've ever been on. I actually hated forums, simply because all the shit posts would be left on there, whereas with Reddit, posts that are good rise to the top, and posts that are bad slide farther down. It's rare when i need to read the first 5 top comments to get the clarification I was looking for."
t3_1am01f,c90exnn,"But think of it this way: if common people were put in charge, how would they organize society? The first thing they'd do is try to automate all the unwanted jobs in that society, whereas the AnCap society would try to automate only the those jobs whereby doing so would bring the greatest profits. These two things don't always intersect."
t3_1am01f,c90exnn,"You don't work, you get kicked out (just like at work, where you'd be fired). The second thing they'd do is pursue virtual non-scarcity in essential goods (whereas the AnCap society would still apply markets to essentially non-scarce goods, the same way the De Beers family hoards the world's diamonds in order to create false scarcity and the same way data companies can easily give you unlimited data packages but choose not to in order to create false scarcity). I've said before that we are actually approaching virtual non-scarcity in certain goods: food (through the new technology which allows us to 3D print meat), plastics (through making all of our plastics from plant-based substances), and energy (through the advancement of renewable energy sources)."
t3_1am01f,c90exnn,"With 3D printers, we have virtually infinite anything-made-from-plastic-and-metal at our fingertips. The AnCap society would slap patents and intellectual property laws all over these things, whereas the anarchist society would encourage these things to the fullest extent, because the people working on them would not be doing them for profits, but because that is what they love to do. That is their passion in life."
t3_33y71i,cqphhsd,"But there is a real cost to doing so, that people in any economic system, not just Capitalism, will have to pay. The difference is, in Capitalism, people choose what they want to pay for, whereas a Planned Economy will force people to make decisions that they don't want to make. "
t3_30oi71,cpubj6z,"Since illegal immigrants can't access the basic income scheme, they would be living on starvation wages. So BI would lower illegal immigration, whereas the existing scheme would not. "
t3_2uudze,cobzyv2,"It's quite different from hearing two soccer moms say what level they're on in candy crush. The moniker of ""gamer"" implies that you're more hardcore with the whole hobby and want to associate with gamers more, whereas Mr. Joe Smith on his way to his accounting job on his morning commute is more likely than not trying to burn his idle time with some Threes! or Crossy Road."
t3_2uj4yv,co8y43y,"see the Tragedy of the Commons for an easy example (if all actors are acting in a purely competitive and rational way, they will overutilize a shared, limited resource until it is depleted). In the real world, that would manifest itself in people overfishing waters until there are no fish left, and that is the normal result of everybody attempting to maximize their profit rationally, whereas the ""correct"" answer is for everybody to only fish as much as is sustainable, which actually increases their profit over time, but sustainable fishing is not a stable situation - any individual is highly incentivized to renege on their agreement with the others and fish more. Laws are required to make sure that each individual does the right thing."
