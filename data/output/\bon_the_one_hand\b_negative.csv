t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"cutting foreign aid from £10B to £2B 

I'm really on the fence about this, my more extreme biases might come out here so i'll keep it brief. on the one hand it seems Farage might have read [Dead Aid by Dambisa Moyo](http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/0141031182), which is a really intriguing take on the effects of development aid to third world countries and presents some pretty convincing arguments, which are rather condescending and offensive actually. On the other hand (warning now i get extreme) Britain has built a great deal of wealth from stealing, raping and pillaging the rest of the world, this is undeniable."
