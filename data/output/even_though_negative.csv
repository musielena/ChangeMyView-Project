t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"I think that people that openly hunt down those they don't agree with online IRL are the reason people use 4chan and other anonymous forums. After a night of drinking even on reddit, I check my comments and prune them accordingly even though I only have a handful of friends that know who I really am. I don't want any of these fascist politically correct fuckbags bothering me IRL."
t3_2qmhw7,cn7kwnd,"I suppose some people might be satisfied with constructing fantasy scenarios with their partner. But it is weakness to post pictures, or weakness to decide that you are too ashamed or worried about consequences to post pictures, even though you want to? Are you saying that it is weakness to want to post pictures in the first place?"
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her ""seemingly minor"" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu. I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all."
t3_2q4trg,cn2x9e7,"The religious person loses it and strikes them. I think this deserves some amount of ""heat of the moment"" consideration, even though for most people it would be completely unshocking or even hard to understand (""SO's an atheist, so? divorce him/her and move on"")."
t3_2n900k,cmld565,"You have to show how the government came to own everything. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction#Corporate_personhood Basically, the government treats corporations as people, even though that's not logical (but the government controls the court system, so legally they're people) I'd like to challenge your belief that a company can become a monopoly by cutting prices way below profit for an extended period of time and recover enough afterward to keep all other potential competitors out. Many people believe this, but we shouldn't base our beliefs on what others think."
t3_2n8psp,cmbzbs2,But it did come along. And it came along even though I wasn't looking for it. (I wasn't against it.
t3_2mv3n4,cm82ay0,"then it was rape!"" even though it really does not read like a rape account. I do think some people are too eager to label encounters ""rape"", and that can definitely make people feel worse than they need to."
t3_2kuu7n,clp3n3x,"It really all comes down to what people are willing to spend. If I want to purchase something for $10 even though it only costed 5 cents to produce, why not allow me? "
t3_2kuu7n,cloyjd8,"We are people that want shit and want it NOW! More money = more better and we gotta look good in our fancy sports cars that can go 250 mph even though the highway speed limit is 55 mph. If consumers wanted to put a profit cap on corporations, they could do so in an instant simply by closing their wallets."
t3_2i0v1l,cky4z54,"But there's diminishing returns. The difference between working on your future career 90% of the time versus 100% is very small compared to 0% versus 10%, even though it is the same amount of time. As long as you put in decent effort, that's the bulk of the future value."

t3_2gzyj0,ckok1e7,"I was in Boston when the marathon bombings happened. Terrorism affected everyone on the streets, even though only 3 people were killed. The scope of an act of terrorism is much greater than the strict number of casualties."
t3_2gly57,ckkjp8m,"and so on. In short, I'll put it this way, if we did trade with them, I could see it being much like Laos, in that you don't see too many naive westerners defending Lao's current system of government, even though they're also socialist. TL;DR: The situation in Cuba is more like us than you think, except worse."
t3_2fwmff,ckdijfs,"Marriage is more of an emotional thing than a business decision. Actually, I'm not even sure if this applies in law, even though it seems fair, so I can't say that I agree or disagree. That's partially what I was going for, because I got the impression you felt no sympathy for men in these situations."
t3_2fu5da,ckd5eaz,"I think some of it may actually come from the way evolutionary scientists sometimes use the word. I've heard it used many times as a shorthand for any sort of behavioral plasticity, even though the people using it obviously understand that it's not conscious. "
t3_2fjsjb,cka49p5,"I think the Gibson in its application is also more versatile. Strats are seldom used for heavier, high gain metal sounds even though a lot of classic metal guitars seem to have strat like qualities (body design, neck thickness, etc.) The guitar just can't handle high gain as well as others, such as the Les Paul which I'd say is a top contender."
t3_2fdmwl,ck8io4p,"Thought experiments: Climbing the Everest with a wooden leg is an amazing accomplishment. Being dropped on top of the Everest by a helicopter is not, even though the result is the same. Process matters."
t3_2dn11e,cjr71xy,"Finally I leave you with he story of Takeru Kobayashi: He doubled the Nathan's hot dog eating record in a single year because he played the game in a way no one else even thought to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeru_Kobayashi I'm not going to go into the ""we're all different love yourself"" thing, even though I believe, it, because I don't think that's what you are asking. It all depends on your goals."
t3_2dn11e,cjr71xy,"If you're comparing yourself to someone else your tying yourself to their success level and progress, and not creating your own new level that can exceed others.

t3_2d8gej,cjn905a,"However, what of the consequences for family, friends, society as a whole? Certainly kidnapping the world's top AIDS researcher wouldn't be justified, even though he would maximize his own happiness. Also, assume that the hook up is only temporary."
t3_2cmtbr,cjh02im,"I think there are many paths to success as an artist and fan art is definitely a helpful avenue to practice one's skills and also piggyback onto well-known franchises for success. Making fan art can actually distinguish one's own artistic style and fame even though it's technically fan-art, like in these examples. "
t3_2byn0m,cjabwg5,However if you want to teach history I do think the DOI is probably the document to study. Kind of like in math class you study calculus even though the laws of physics are more important/relevant. 
t3_2bag31,cj3f08t,"It may be a part of the culture to show off your many charitable deeds, but a billionaire who gives a lot of money to charity is still doing something he or she doesn't have to do, and if they give enough it is unexpected. And even though I think a poor person giving money is sacrificing more, nevertheless if the rich person donates a large enough amount, it can affect his or her lifestyle in a significant way; they're not giving up anything they need , but they can potentially give up something that they want and something that they'll miss . They may not be more generous than you, but they're still generous."
t3_2ba26t,cj3fcgi,"The first point to keep in mind is that most simple review and rating systems descend into this no matter how well-intentioned their goals are. For example, some video game magazines and websites use 10 point reviewing schemes -- but very often they will not rate a game that is ""acceptable"" as any lower than a 7, even though the numbers suggest that a 5-6 would be ""acceptable."" This is largely because, to many customers, ""good enough isn't good enough"", which is probably a result of a culture that promotes and strives for excellence."
t3_2aotoi,cixdemv,"Bit hypocritical. I used the Jehovahs witness scenario because that is what the Hobby Lobby case opened up, even though we think its stupid and asinine to think that a religion would deny coverage for something that is life saving (while I agree plan-b isn't) they still now have the OPTION to do it! They could sue, and possibly win, weather we think its a good thing or not."
t3_29pjwk,cin94yc,"An appeal to authority is a specific form of inductive reasoning, but not all inductive reasoning consists of an appeal to authority. For example, if I note that everyone born prior to, say, 1850 was human and died, and then infer from this that all humans will eventually die, I have not appealed to any authority even though I have made an inductive inference. Your argument is like arguing that since penguins are animals, all animals are penguins."
t3_29o0d3,cimx6xh,"The choice isn't between Christianity and atheism, it's between Christianity, atheism, and about a thousand other religions. If Christianity turns out to be wrong, and Islam is true, you're still going to Hell even though you chose religion. This is also simply not true."

t3_29n4wo,cimrxy5,"If so I don't think there is anything necessarily immoral with what you are doing but the most common purpose for people's lives is their family and the connections they form with their SO's. Love means different things to different people but even though we try to make sacrifices for those we ""love"" they are still sacrifices that we would rather not make if not necessary. It really comes down to whether or not you are prepared to give the same thing to someone else as you expect to get from them."
t3_29n4wo,cimqk8p,"I've spent the past three nights sitting on my front porch doing nothing but having conversations with her. She fits all of these expectations even I personally was beginning to think might be a bit too ridiculous, from a person who was ""Christian gone agnostic"" to ""at least a 6/10"" to ""doesn't want to live in the city, even though we currently live in the city."" Trust me man, I've got a list longer than it ever has been and this girl is going through with flying colors."
t3_298jbk,ciijbdz,"In fact I would go as far as to say some paid programs are way worse than the free ones. Mcafee would be one, along with Norton (which for some reason got onto your list even though its clearly paid. Free trials are not free antivirus programs)."
t3_24uvqn,chb7e9p,"Yes, there have been many recalls and discontinuations of drugs brought to market. That is because even though it can take 10-15 years to bring a drug to market, we still rarely have any idea of long-term side effects that can manifest. Secondly, some recalls and product discontinuations aren't necessarily because a drug is dangerous."
t3_24bof3,ch5phng,"If C was closer to B than A, that means those 15% of people who voted C probably would have voted B if C didn't exist and they still had to choose the lesser of the only two evils there. Therefore, this 15% of voters probably almost exclusively came from people who would have voted B, meaning instead of the normal 50% for A and 50% for B election, it went 50% for A, 35% for B, and 15% for C, having A win demandingly even though the same 50% really didn't want A in office. There is so much wrong with the US voting system I could go on for hours."
t3_23gsm4,cgwtza2,"But adoption happens because otherwise the child could starve or have poor nutrition. For the sake of discussion I'll assume all of your claims about adoption's effect on children are correct, even though they are not. According to Maslow and scientific consensus, basic sustenance is more important than ""identity-formation,"" because it is the foundation of survival."
t3_22s540,cgq0y5h,"Thank you so much anonymous person, I appreciate the kindness :). This oughta be a fun thought experiment, and I think I'll write it as a narrative even though I doubt I'll get much notice! The war begins in D.C, and spreads throughout the Union."
t3_225n20,cgjto4c,"Example: Nobody really makes an issue about the fact that I can't really wear clothes that accentuate my female form without having a panic attack because I wear mostly men's clothes and it's a non-issue. Were I to be coming form a male starting point, the fact that I love crocheting and collect hello kitty crap would be something for most people to mock, even though it's less obvious than anything I wear. I'm not trans, but I'm not comfortable with the gender I was assigned and am now supposed to just live with."
t3_219hvy,cgbqj7y,It's just something people enjoy. And even though there are shitty people on the vinyl community (I've met plenty) a lot of us are just people who love records and music. 
t3_21006g,cg8jacm,"A number of my friends from university were atheists or agnostics to some degree, with some coming from religious backgrounds and some not. One very good friend, let's call her Ashley, told me, knowing that I was a Christian, that she liked that her parents encouraged her to choose her own faith even though they didn't hold any formal religious beliefs. She said that they took her to a number of churches to expose her to alternative viewpoints, and in the end, she decided that none of them had a significant enough appeal for her to continue to go."
t3_20bc4h,cg1q9b0,"I work with adults with severe intellectual disabilities. Most of them have parents who are involved with them, even though the clients live at houses that we maintain. Some of them are retirement age."
t3_1yoc2s,cfmyafl,It doesn't matter as long as you are male-like in other traits. It makes the stereotypes not very useful even though males do share traits. The definition would require a certain number of those traits and the lack of a certain number of other traits.
t3_1xg9o8,cfb8rco,"It would be so absolutely detrimental to the gun rights groups that it would probably end up shifting opinion. News stories about settlements being handed out, and teachers going to jail for shooting their students (even though it was negligent), would make people go ""Wait you mean the people I trust with my kids suck with guns... I don't want my neighbor to have a gun, that dude is just an accountant, they are way less responsible then teachers""..."
t3_1xg9o8,cfb8rco,"I don't want my neighbor to have a gun, that dude is just an accountant, they are way less responsible then teachers""... I'm not saying it wouldn't save more lives then it would end, I'm saying all you need is a few accidents (which will happen) and suddenly all you will hear about is the armed teachers who shot students on accident, and with the drop in school shootings, the only thing people will remember is the presence of guns in these schools is killing kids, not saving them, even though the exact opposite may be true. Ninja Edit- Also don't discount the one teacher who might go crazy and kill a few kids on purpose before other teachers can get over to stop him."
t3_1we5ye,cf1drrq,"But also, stopping and starting are when I'm most likely to simply fall over (because of the specific pedals I use that mechanically fasten to my shoes). Falling over is much more dangerous than staying upright, so even though it is unlikely for me to fall, it is better to keep moving. I am extra cautious when it is a 2 way stop sign because a car I don't notice isn't going to be stopping for me."
t3_1w6uhl,cezh5ah,"The babies were literally taken from their parents and sold to westerners for cheap prices. Chinese adoptions, even though they're overseas, are often more affordable and ""safe"" to the adoptive parents than American adoption. This is mainly because lots of them children are stolen and sold for for really cheap."
t3_1vougq,ceudmfn,"Putting aside the fact that it takes time and training to become good at construction, cleanup, social work or tutoring. [And I have to pause to ask, if you really think that it's a good idea to take an 18 year old with no training who is there under duress getting paid minimum wage (even though if they had been working through school they might be making more) and put them with vulnerable people needing a social worker? ] What do you think would happen to the people who would traditionally be doing those jobs at more than minimum wage?"
t3_1vbtut,ceqwdz5,"If the hour hand was set not to move until the hour had passed then I would be forced to look at the exact position of the minute hand. If the minute hand is still at the 59 minute point, but at a glance it looks like it's pointing straight up then my reading of the time would be 2:00, even though the actual time is 2:59. "
t3_1tqlde,ceahwfu,"The danger of myths is not that they are not real, is that society will force children to believe that they are real long after the child is able to feel their way around reality on their own. This creates a conflict for the child because just as they are learning to distinguish fantasy from reality, adults throw a curveball and tell them ""well, even though this LOOKS like fantasy, it's actually real and some day you'll get to see Grandma in heaven. No, I can't prove it. """
t3_1tqlde,ceahwfu,"There are very crucial distinctions between childhood fantasies and religion. They are not interchangeable concepts, even though they are related psychologically. It is NOT hypocritical to let a child believe in Santa and not let a child believe in religion."
t3_1te39z,ce71ql3,"But examining the evidence you can estimate the probability to be zero point a few zeros which makes the term ""agnostic"" not really valuable if you use it for such probabilities. This is why I would call myself an atheist, and not an agnostic, even though I technically am. "
t3_1t9irv,ce5r69v,"Catholics stress tradition as well as the Bible. That's why Catholics have all these holidays celebrating saints and why Catholics venerate saints even though saints aren't referenced in the Bible at all. Religion exists among illiterate tribes of people, so a canon isn't a necessary condition for a religion."
t3_1qy1k7,cdhqdd4,"I am just wondering if you think people should be able to choose their second language or if you feel they should be encouraged to learn the most ""helpful"" language. Say I decided to learn Konkani because I find it interesting even though it will NEVER have a practical use in my life. Would it still fulfill your requirement or would it be viewed as a hobby and I would still be required to learn another useful language?"
t3_1qdzt5,cdbwdog,"Although most social groups are composed of average intellectual people, there are groups that are highly (or at least more ) selective for intellectualism: it could be argued that this subreddit (/r/changemyview) is slightly more selective for intellectual behavior than Reddit as a whole. Thus, you are right, even though the bulk of Reddit is much closer to the baseline, there are subreddits that are farther deviations toward intellectualism than the baseline. For example, the ratio of changed minds is probably higher on here than the rest of Reddit: people here are more likely to be open-minded: just look at how many deltas are transacted."
t3_1pp78v,cd4kcgh,"When dealing with suicide, it's better to err on the side of caution and try to convince people to not give up. Because there's a good chance they haven't tried anything (even though they think they did) or things will look better soon (even though they think they won't). "
t3_1pet7o,cd1m2v2,"Before, most reasonable people would assume that distracted driver laws included text messaging. Yet, many people have been able to argue their way out of fines in court by saying that even though they were texting, they weren't distracted. Now, by explicitly banning the use of text while driving, there is much less wiggle room for highly paid lawyers to save their clients with."
t3_1pbxrs,cd0uwwl,"Yes it's possible that every single person who has ever studied the vaccine has missed a side effect, but it is incredibly unlikely. It is frustrating that even though vaccines are highly effective, very inexpensive, have minimal side effects, have been rigorously tested, and have saved billions of lives, people who don't understand even the basics of medicine will refuse them because they are afraid. For example, people are afraid of autism, but instead of trying to find the root cause, they simply blame vaccines, despite the fact that the only person why has ever suggested that they were responsible was proven to be a liar and a fraud."
t3_1on8j3,cctugxw,"Nothing. Short of a small minority group of whackjobs, nobody wants teachers to become law enforcement officers (even though the case could be made that some teachers and school officials seem to think that they are). Concealed carrying doesn't make you a cop any more than a first aid kit qualifies you to perform brain surgery."
t3_1n3wo2,ccffwtl,"[6] He was charged with killing hundreds of blacks in South Africa and Namibia via injected poisons. He was never convicted in South African courts, even though his lieutenants testified,"" in detail and with consistency"" about the medical crimes they conducted against blacks.

t3_1ms5h6,ccc6q8t,"I know it is anecdotal but I know many vets and vet nurses that I would trust with my health over many human doctors and nurses that I have met. Your issue with efficacy of treatment is just as valid regardless of species, as even though some people may be able to diagnoses themselves correctly other's accounts of their symptoms may completely mislead the doctor. On top of this most have no medical training and could be given prescriptions or treatments that will have no more than placebo effect, again regardless of species."
t3_1ma1o7,cc78d5z,"Additionally, suppose they made an error when they put on my cast which resulted in some discomfort to me? I would feel just fine about complaining about it, even though the care was a net gain. Complaining about and bringing people's attention to negatives results in improvement later on."
t3_1l5skj,cbw5e2q,"The state did not do its job. In fact, the state learns that planting evidence helps put the bad guys away-- even though there was originally no evidence that the suspect committed a crime. Maybe next week they plant the evidence in your car, and for whatever reason your attorney can't demonstrate reasonable doubt, and now you're going to prison for a crime you didn't commit."
t3_1l3r2u,cbvi11k,"Being formally educated in a variety of areas means you're more likely to be able to do that. I know it might not mean much to you, but even though I'm a STEM major, I secretly (and sometimes not so secretly...) judge people who don't get the references to Shakespeare that I might make, or who do not know what a ""Francophile"" is, or who think that WWII started in 1949.

t3_1kzxcm,cbuiv91,"It's much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother. The problem is, even though it's brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is. Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time."
t3_1kjxxx,cbprup5,"As well as an atheist isn't always a basher of religion hoping that everybody starts to believe them and their views. I'm friends with a highly Christian person, and even though there are things we argue about, it's all based on opinion and we have had a wonderful friendship for almost 20 years. I am also in a relationship with a man who is atheist while I am agnostic (believe in god/heaven/just-live-kindly) and I far from think my SO will ever share the same beliefs as me, nor I him."
t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"I may be wrong but I'm fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent. I know I would be weary to hit a woman who hit me since I would perceive it as wrong, even though logically that makes no sense. This might not be about gender roles and just about justice porn (we even have a subreddit for it) which reddit loves like /u/BenIncognito points out, but you don't even have to agree with that."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"Smartphones aren't just for work, they're also for people who like power hungry apps like netflix and youtube. So even though they could make less powerful ones for work only, they still have to be powerful for those other users anyway. You get to use your little smartphone for work and home life, it's awesome!"
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But if I could afford a smartphone, I'd buy one, if I didn't already have a tablet (it was a gift). My mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) I gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"But when she went back to our home country (splits her year between america and our home country because she has young grand children there), my brother didn't know how to use linux so he replaced it with windows for her. So the computer became a fucking mess even though all she does is read and watch news! Not to mention she hates windows because it's so difficult to use, and she misses linux :P Anyway, the computer becoming a mess is not a problem with an android/iphone, anyone who's used them once can use it anytime again in any other device."
t3_1kd3wi,cboaqqz,"I mostly agree with you, but it's important to remember that ""human morality"" both contains rules/guidelines about what we can morally do (that is, what rights other beings have), and what we should do. Thus, even though I agree that animals don't have rights because we have no reason to restrict ourselves in our dealings with them, in certain cases it is still in our self-interest to not treat them poorly - not out of consideration for them, but out of consideration for ourselves. Specifically, though factory farming and such are fine even when they cause animal suffering, it is because the suffering isn't the goal but an undesirable yet acceptable side effect of the real goal, which is relatively inexpensive food."
t3_1kcow1,cbnlbww,"The South dominated the Federal Government and aimed to keep things local - not just for slavery, but because even if you are against slavery as some southerners were, you believe that's the best way to run a government. I think it's possible that a lot of southerners still believe this today, even though they may not be aware that it came from Jefferson and Democrats. Have you ever heard that the South was a Democrat holdout for a long time - well into the 1900s?"

Almost without fail though, there are people who sincerely believe something based on faith even though there is scientific evidence to the contrary. There is no scientific way to determine the existence of god, yet, and I honestly doubt that there ever will be, but (in my opinion) people have accepted on faith that there isn't, which may seem like a weird way of phrasing that to somebody, especially an atheist."
t3_1gndd7,caly3r9,"You have yet to give me a good reason why the fact that science proves materialism affects the answers of any of these questions. For example, there are plenty of philosophers of mind who believe that consciousness cannot be replicated, even though they are materialists. Your view, while it seems to make the most sense, is also the least reflective."
t3_1f5j5p,ca7p4d4,"I present and dress in a very masculine manner, but I have feminine qualities, too. But I don't like the idea of being a woman and hate that everyone sees me as such, even though I understand why they do. I just feel like myself."
t3_1ekme5,ca1ende,"Often that debate revolves around the meaning of words. So even though they are not completely solved, for the part that has been solved, the solution often comes from mathematics or physics or another science. One reason for this is that the philosophical problems that can be solved by pure reasoning, are mostly easy, so nobody thinks about them anymore."
t3_1duzzk,c9u8yoe,"The difference would occur randomly, because some people would die unexpectedly.

t3_1d7g4o,c9nxhbi,"It's just magical thinking at that point. You are basically reduced to saying that even though there's absolutely zero reason to think it and plenty to not think it, it might possibly be true that XYZ. Well if that sort of logic impresses you why would you be an atheist?"

t3_1cfa2w,c9g116t,"You did lay out how nuclear disasters are rare and usually the result of human error, but that ignores the true cost of the disasters. When these things go bad (and they have kept going bad, even though we know WHY they can go bad) it costs billions and billions and billions of dollars to fix it. Things keep happening, and will continue to happen, that lead to nuclear accidents."
t3_1bjd8m,c97aro1,"In college you're taught that your GPA is basically your worth but the fact is, a GPA is only an indicator and a somewhat flawed one at that. In terms of hiring, a 3.9 gpa is the same as a 3.8 even though the difference between the two might be huge academically. Also, academic indications like GPA and school placement are only measures of your technical performance."
t3_1ayifp,c91y4yc,"Second point: I've blabbed before, on this (see above) but it comes down to the experience you gain, and the memories you will cherish as you get older. I love reminiscing about the fun I had with my previous girlfriends, and even though I don't talk to them, I know our thoughts will sometimes cross. As for their friends, it is something that should be made clear from the beginning, in my opinion."
t3_33ltmy,cqmkixu,"Honestly, I recently had to shut down the NGO and not renew the license because it wasn't going anywhere without money, and I'm not going to be in Canada for the next few years anyway. That said, I'm patiently waiting for the conservatives to get out, even though I finally reached the age of majority and still can't vote (I'm only a permanent resident). I can't say I'm particularly optimistic about the political future of Canada though."

t3_33ltmy,cqmopca,"Thanks for reading the comment, I think that is a good plan, and this is a rapidly expanding field. I am somewhat hopeful about the environment because even though it is being destroyed, we also have people in professions like yours dedicated to trying to save it. I think there will be a lot of trying times, but efforts like yours will be crucial in protecting people from our own mistakes."

t3_33ltmy,cqm92o8,"A small segment of roadway that surrounds the airfield requires some work and one of the options was to relocate the road 21 feet further from the airfield - affecting 42 linear feet bay shoreline (unnatural shoreline that was once the boarder of a landfill). Everyone laughed about the 20 year study that would require and the millions in litigation, and it was effectively not pursued, even though it was a much better alternative. If you look at things like shorelines, pollutants, and ground water contamination concerns, I would say environmental engineers are doing a damn good job at improving the world."

t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"So adding the Holocaust to that can stir up some pretty sad and strong feelings about how people feel about Jews, and lots of us can't help but feel protective and like we are being targeted even today in areas that we are relatively safe in. I do think that even though we may be aware that the whole world doesn't actually want us dead, many of us are certainly afraid that someday, that sentiment will become popular (again-ish), and personally, I can't fault anyone for fearing that. Yeah, I don't think a conversation about freedom of speech has to include a long list of everyone in someone's Jewish family who died, but I do think if we're talking about the nastiness of Holocaust denial and anti-semitism (I hope you don't mind that I'm continuing to use that word - I prefer it over anti-Judaism because discrimination against Jews is at least partially due to our ethnicity, rather than our primary religion) it's relevant for a Jewish person to bring up their own history or experiences with it, even if it's not something that ""directly"" happened to them."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"Like, we stepped in and saved the Jews! But we never learned in my classes, for example, that the US turned away many, many Jews trying to escape the Holocaust, even though the immigration quota was nowhere near filled for most of the war. They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went."
t3_33jriw,cqlu5ff,"They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went. So even though the Holocaust is pretty ingrained, there's still a lot of pieces missing from the full puzzle of shared blame. And it's going to take Jewish people talking about that for quite some time before that's as ingrained as the rest of the information we learn about the Holocaust."
t3_309gc1,cpqcrp3,"A third of ballots were left blank in protest for the wording of the questions. So even though there was a referendum in 2012, it's still not clear exactly what the majority of Puerto Ricans want in regards to their status. If a majority (or at least plurality) of Puerto Ricans are ok with the current situations, then what's the issue?"
t3_306owt,cpq6ae3,I also think it was worth everything I put in to it. Almost all of my friends today were met through swimming so even though I haven't swam in a couple years it still has a positive effect on my life. 
t3_2y2tk3,cp5x9us,"It is mostly fluff and misses a lot of important nuances, but it conveys the general concept. I agree that it is reasonable to allow rhetorical wiggle room for people making this statement even though it misses a lot of nuances of the issue. The statement that ""Darren Wilson is a monster"" or is guilty etc."
t3_2y1qef,cp5hsqg,"It's just a different place to draw the line. Well, as I said, it's a purely personal stance, but I'm pretty libertarian, so I take the side of no, the government should not be forcing people to do anything to themselves against their will, even though it's very clearly beneficial for society as a whole. Others will have different opinions, and I can't say they're wrong."
t3_2xrgw2,cp38m66,"I'm crafty, good at pattern recognition, enjoy game theory, and have a knack for the more mundane math found in accounting. I like reading about statistics and probabilities - even though I'm bad at doing them. My talents lead me to the school of business, it's the kind of work I actually have a knack for."
t3_2wt9ya,cotx5b0,"You see that jailing those guilty of no crime is wrong. It is objectively wrong, even though you live in a time and place where it is morally acceptable. And that you can't go there suggests you know there is some objective morality."
t3_2wt9ya,cotytfh,"I prefer to talk in terms of whether or not behavior was moral. People are generally not evil, in the sense that they seek to do wrong, but they are often immoral, in the sense that they do wrong even though that is not their goal. But, yes, immoral actions are immoral whether or not you know they are immoral."
t3_2s3ey4,cnn50va,"But yeah if I was gonna debate this, I'd start there. I'm gonna play devil's advocate even though I agree with you for the most part. Here is what people will say every time you bring this up: ""How could you not be sad leaving all your friends/family behind?!!"""
