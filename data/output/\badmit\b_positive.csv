t3_2pimzj,cmx2c61,"I was specifically looking for someone to shed light on a group that I have never been personally involved with, yet had strong opinions on, because I may want my daughter to get involved. CMV is a sub where there appears to be a more cordial attitude toward debate with less impassioned mud-slinging, derision, and name calling (though I admit I have only been viewing content for a couple of weeks). It seems that if someone really wanted to get on a soapbox, they could merely head to a sub that specifically handled their topic (politics, religion, etc.)"
t3_2m9le3,cm28iwd,"If you want to start a project try to see if you can keep it up on your own at a certain time per day without your planner. If not, feel free to admit. :) --- TLDR: go to bed and get up at regular times every day."
t3_2llfy2,clvxvqf,"If this was the condition for  not* having unisex bathrooms, then everywhere would have unisex bathrooms and thus there would be an increase in harassment. Also you yourself admit that high schools should maybe be included, well a shit-ton of harassment happens in the workplace - so what's the threshold here? "
t3_2j7d65,cl91nh6,"I'm not sure I understand you. What's wrong with using racism to mean discrimination based on race, which you admit is still a present problem? We have other words for other types of discrimination, you used a lot of them."
t3_2iu5ia,cl8r5p5,"Dissent on the majority opinion is needed to make sure that the ideas are continually re evaluated to make sure they are as self evident as they are claimed to be. finally I hope that makes sense, because Ive been up since 12am yesterday, Ive had a rough day so I'll admit im half coherent. so if shits all misspelled or theres words out of place, or even rants that go off topic I apologize."
t3_2giql7,ckm2t5e,"BUT, we now live in the world where women are not reliant upon men, and they are not defined purely based on their 'intrinsic value' of having a womb. Most men, whether they admit it or not, would hate being in a relationship with a beautiful but personality-less girl. Yes, they are going to get some beautiful offsprings, but other things do matter(for most of us, whether we admit it or not)."
t3_2giql7,ckm2t5e,"Most men, whether they admit it or not, would hate being in a relationship with a beautiful but personality-less girl. Yes, they are going to get some beautiful offsprings, but other things do matter(for most of us, whether we admit it or not). IF you are smart, make a decent living, you enjoy fucking, you like dick, have a healthy lifestyle and body, can make a man happy, then men will find you a worthy mate(there are other factors too btw)."
t3_2gdd35,ckhzino,"Also, with how rampant STDs course through younger generations, I don't think we have a ""good"" means of preventing them, just a means. So, specifically in a religious context, to admit that was the reason would mean to admit God didn't say this on a moral or ethical level, but that the church just meant to control the population. Which would be to say The Bible is a lie."
t3_2f48co,ck5siun,"This is a very unusual conspiracy theory to hold (and despite your proclamation to the contrary, it is most definitely a conspiracy theory) because Hollywood has traditionally been accused of being full of hard-left communists, something that generally runs counter to your claims. I must admit I don't see any easy way to convince you that you're wrong, because it's not really clear why you believe this stuff. I know we're supposed to be changing your view, not vice versa, but where's your evidence?"
t3_2f1tka,ck53vic,"If you accept a different definition of rape--one that stems from a deep-rooted power imbalance between men and women--I think it's easier to imagine that being removed from the culture (slowly, yes) without demonizing a large group of innocent people. Well, first let me admit that I'm about to describe a really unpopular view, but at least hear me out. I think your definition of rape is definitely a fair legal definition, not least of all for evidentiary reasons."
t3_2cixjs,cjfyd92,"It has no motive to do so. I'm trying to put myself in the programs shoes and must admit humanity seems like a rather abstract and far removed concept. They lived in a world separate from mine, a string of data I know but can't understand."
t3_2c6m3v,cjd67az,"After 4-6 years of Critical thinking instruction, you could reasonably assume that these kids would be in what is currently the top 10 percentile in terms of critical thinking ability, and so what benefit would you expect to gain from teaching them philosophy? In my mind, something like game theory would be a better extension, but I'll admit I haven't thought deeply on what one should do after they've achieved very high levels of critical thinking ability. I think you'll find the beginning of this paper interesting ([Pencil and Paper argument mapping improves Critical Thinking Skills](https://www.academia.edu/772329/No_Computer_Program_Required_Even_Pencil-and-Paper_Argument_Mapping_Improves_Critical_Thinking_Skills))."
t3_2bqdam,cj828mm,"In just 10 years, because of compound interest, it can be worth $1,049.15. I'll admit I'm getting a little bit beyond just paying off the debt now. However, I assume the long-term goal here is financial independence."
t3_2bk0qs,cj64zeg,"Without getting bogged down in the messy logistics involved, what would you think of that solution? Well the issue of the victim's family is a little different, and I do have to admit its less clear cut. I have a hard time accepting that idea as real, meaning I have no reason to believe that solution would actually help the family at all, but I can't unilaterally declare that it would not."
t3_2ah6lr,civ3itz,"Whereas doing so on SRS is a banworthy offense. I'll admit the thread you linked about Islamaphobia is depressing, but I've also seen a lot of instances of people on TiA jumping all over people expressing bigoted views. "
t3_2a7f52,cisazcd,The show isn't for everyone but The show is so much fun if you don't look so closely at its flaws and just take it for what it is. I will admit some episodes are just dreadful but being a show on possibilities the next episode can be anything and when they knock it out of the park they really do a fantastic job. 
t3_29t2lw,cio8m2f,Of course. You admit the cards are stacked against you. Why not fight so other's don't have to face the same roadblock?
t3_27poi8,ci35etu,Because of this I think that it would be best to give students to option to either do a project or a test. First off I have to admit that I have a huge bias. I am far better at tests than I am at projects.
t3_26nxhn,chsvwxu,"The difference between your plan of overusing the words, and the current plan of suffocating them until they die out, is who gets hurt by the plan. In your plan, gay people would suffer a deluge of insults from every direction that they couldn't even admit to being offended by. In the alternative, straight people have to avoid using one word."
t3_255qch,chdyl7n,"That, and I don't like supporting either culture or law in scenarios where it makes no sense. That said, I'll admit it's a personal choice and there's nothing ethically or morally wrong about preferring to always wait. What would you do if the crosswalk light never changed?"
t3_24v147,chbavh7,"They certainly were drama queens. But you've got to admit that people, especially students, rely far too much on the internet for answers. They're used to having information at their fingertips."
t3_2360o1,cgu0cre,"http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-erm.aspx This site gives a very basic glimpse into the relation between SES and race that you can examine more fully on your own. You openly admit that you have no experience of the ""oppression"" and problems that those of lower SES face, which is the basis of your view. Since you are not poor and faced little discrimination it must mean that poverty is the true source of their problems."
t3_216l8g,cga7sga,"Going up to them and leering at them while taking pictures is objectification. But you have to admit, if it were just men marching around without their tops, they would receive zero attention. I don't think these women were surprised that it happened."
t3_1xti2t,cfepy2q,So what should MLB do? Well first they should admit to themselves (not necessarily to the public) that they need to save their sport in order for it survive (if my theory is correct). IT IS PURELY a business model problem.
t3_1xti2t,cfepy2q,"Not a ""social rights/integration problem."" And YES they should admit that the sport is dying amongst Black-Americans. But their approach shouldn't be ""Oh Black people we have a great Black History"" in other words don't try to guilt Blacks into playing it."
t3_1xhrpt,cfbkr47,"The key difference, however, is that Christianity was born through nonviolence, whereas Islam was born through war. Both went to war of course, but the Muslims admit it. However, all of this being said, when Muhammad was alive Islam was barely even a thing."
t3_1wvths,cf614t8,"But if the answer is no (as it would be for likely 95% of people) then you simply couldn't substantiate your viewpoint in an intellectually honest way. With no further assumptions, and without speaking towards the interpretation portion of dream analysis- one would have to admit that if, ever, one's dream(s) do, in fact, have some fidelity with or representation of a real-life concern, scenario, worry, etc., that there is simply no way to say that there could be no benefit in their analysis, once identified as having that fidelity. Speaking of an entirely self-contained system here- working with what it has, both in terms of conscious and subconscious areas, processing massive amounts of information; if some/any portion of that information 'resurfaces' in whatever format (dreams would certainly count) then I believe we would be remiss to say that on some level, the psychological machinery has deemed it important and a good use of limited resources, time, energy etc."
t3_1um2og,cejgnup,"The amount of thimerosal in the vaccines that have it (not all do and you can easily request one that does not have it) have only a trace amount text , so you will need to get a massive volume of the vaccine in your system for it to even have an affect on you, let alone be dangerous. The method to determine exactly what strain to create a vaccine for has some pretty complicated math invovled (which I admit I don't fully understand), URL Because you acknowledge the advantage of herd immunity for malaria and polio, I am going to assume you know how it works. Let me know if you want me to explain it."
t3_1sqkke,ce09y0e,"In the study linked below, it was shown that athletic success for a school translated into a direct increase in the quality and quantity of students applying to the school in the following academic year. This allows universities to either a) admit more students while keeping the quality the same or b) increase standards. Both pay huge dividends for a college in the long run."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy2o2r,So just to make my point clear. Yes I admit that Gandhi has become a propaganda tool for the state. But that does not mean that he did not accomplish stuff which has a lot for us to learn.
t3_1sgl5a,cdy2o2r,"These stupid stories do not discount what Einstein did. Maybe at least you admit that Gandhi the man and Gandhi the propaganda are two different things, and Gandhi is great for different reasons. I would recommend reading him more."
t3_1qwdul,cdj5vts,"I have yet to see a testimonial where a bro is like ""yeah, I negged the shit out of this girl and took her home within the hour and now we are celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary at a B&amp;B in Vermont!"" I don't doubt that it happens, just that, uh I have to admit I'm kind of getting mixed signals here. If women really DO fall for you when they get to know you, I can tell you with absolute confidence that you are already better off than basically every man who can spit mad game but has very little going for him beyond it."
t3_1qw6q4,cdh5dka,"They lie to meet societal expectations. There are quite a few people that engage in actions and don't admit to them as well. Here's an example: the URL According to this theory, most people experience at least a little bit of homosexual attraction some time in their lives."
t3_1qfo09,cdcconr,"As long as those attitudes exist, they can't be equal. Your argument could be rephrased as ""I get that they want to be equal, and I'm find with them having equal rights, I just don't want to admit that they're equal"" You can say two halves or three thirds, but either way it still comes out to the same thing, and there's no valid reason to deny that. People don't want to give up the word marriage because they think it's special, and reserved just for them, and that by letting gays marry they'd be tarnishing the word."
t3_1ozdmq,ccx6cho,No society can survive without that sense of self-interest and by my moral code my society will always come above others. It is not hypocrisy because I do admit I act in self-interest and find no shame in doing so. The people who do spout moral justifications and the endless rationalizations do so because that is what makes them more comfortable to act in their self-interest.
t3_1oee4l,ccrfxpy,"I think a lot of it is just that people don't like having their sexuality, something that only they can know and has played a large portion in their life, openly questioned. For instance, I've had bisexual friends who have both been told ""Oh you're just fully gay, admit it"" or ""You're not actually gay, you're just straight and pretending"" (or something along those lines). They obviously had no problem with gay or straight people, but it's just straight up incorrect and it bugs them when people say it."
t3_1mjw31,ccafvbq,"However everyone will have their own preferences. You also do admit a bias based on what you deem to be ""good scifi"" is hard to find; are you sure that your bias is a solid foundation on which to condemn all prequel-writing authors as ""not serious"" regardless of the merit of their other work? Does this help change your view?"
t3_1l3hck,cbvusd3,"Right, but we can choose how to deal with those offenses. I'll admit that I'm a big advocate for free speech because I think it's been instrumental in the very best ideas that humanity has come up with, so I might be a little biased. But I also steadfastly believe that rights, equality, and acceptance are things that are fought for tooth and nail."
t3_1klpoz,cbqe15e,"Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs. There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both URL and URL (two very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural. They progressed as opposed to mutated."
t3_1kj8ll,cbpjmas,"That they can ""know best"" despite the clear statements of that person about their own sexual identity? You telling me, ""No, you're not really straight, you do like members of the same sex, you just don't want to admit it"" is like conservative parents telling their gay son, ""No, you're not really gay, this is just a phase, you really do like girls."" Both are predicated upon the speaker knowing how the person really feels, despite that person's years of self-discovery."
t3_1kj8ll,cbpj892,"If that was the case, I'd expect much more than 10% of the population (the highest figure I've heard) of people to be bi/homosexual, just due to random variations pushing them far enough to the other end. I don't think that it is so much a matter of refusing to admit, as the feelings literally not existing, or at least not consciously. I believe that if society (etc) fully accepted homosexuality, there would be more men who would be attracted to men (and women to women) as they would then think about it."
t3_1jiw0b,cbf50ig,"I don't care what that something is, or in what manner it exists, or wether it's an illusion or not, just that: There is something - as opposed to not something. Even to deny this is to admit it! For a denial is itself something as opposed to not something!"
t3_1j44fb,cbawgr0,"When you listen to a song on a streaming service, they're monetizing you somehow, like with ads, and some of that is going back to the artist, such that you're really not ""getting it for free"". Therefore, every song that you download without paying for, rather than listening to on a streaming service as you admit you otherwise would, you actually are denying the artists a bit of money. "
t3_1hajga,cass9ux,"To argue otherwise seems to take such a negative view of both men's and women's fundamental characters that it would stand to argue men and women should be totally segregated because it's toxic for them to have interaction in any sort of professional setting. On this topic I admit there wasn't a lot of hand to hand combat in my service branch, especially in the rate I was a member of. If you have experience in this area I must yield to your presumed superior first hand knowledge on the subject."
t3_1ghg9u,cakhjuz,"The Koran, like many religious texts (including the bible), often appears contradictory. I admit I don't know as much about the history of the Koran as I should, but for the bible, it is fairly easy to explain why - all the books were written by different people, and though divinely inspired, they simply didn't cross-check everything to make sure the points were the same. For 8.065 specifically, it seems like that verse is the Koran equivalent of Luke 1:37 - ""Nothing is impossible with god""."
t3_1f5j5p,ca7188z,"(which will be transferred into attention whore and snowflake stats, I'm sure.) Whether or not gender queer is recognized (and I'm friends with many people who'd sooner die than admit I'm not an ordinary straight male, even though I've experiences in life that make it easier for me to talk to women and the LGBT community, than to other straight men), it exists, as itself. There is nothing else quite like it...for now, anyways."
t3_1ehvba,ca0getj,"More often than not, it isn't. If you divorce war from the reality of the massive death and suffering caused I admit it doesn't seem as bad. That's a trivial statement, however; death and suffering are the primary cost of war."
t3_1dy3sl,c9uym99,"Or the outdated and offensive traditional gender roles that feminists are trying to get rid of? Now, I'm definitely going to admit that feminism hasn't really done a good job of addressing these issues, but hell, earlier this year, 80% of congress and the senate were men, and even that was considered a breakthrough in the amount of women present in the US government. I don't know why you think that feminists are the ones creating these toxic ideas when we're still fighting for rudimentary things like birth control and abortion rights."
t3_1cjeto,c9h2lgb,"Well first of all you'd have to accept that many people do actually like the taste, even though you personally don't. I'll admit it was an acquired taste where i didnt like most alcoholic beverages at first, but over time those flavors built up positive associations in my mind and i found myself enjoying them. Despite not particularly.liking them at first, nowadays i'll have some whiskey just for the pleasre of drinking it (flavor, feel, and buzz)."
t3_1cc8uk,c9f82sn,"Also what if some company decides to market a synthetic drug that is thousands of times more addictive than anything we've ever seen but it can't be regulated because its for personal enjoyment. Prostitution: I agree, but regulating would be expensive and no married man will ever be able to publicly admit he's for it. Public nudity/sex: How would this be illegal if there is no one to stand as witness to it?"
t3_1c8ym3,c9e9zzx,"That is the sort of ""safe space"" /r/MR is: it allows people, of all genders, to go and say ""hey, I don't like this aspect of society"" and not be immediately accused of being driven by hatred. I'll admit that occasionally, MR sickens me, but as much as the occasional instances of clear misogyny revolt me, I cannot help but go back on occasion, because without them to tell me that no, I'm not mad and evil and hateful to point out the hypocrisy of gender politics, I would go mad, and drift into actual misogyny out of bitter resentment at the double standard. "
t3_1c8ym3,c9e9ga5,"Those trolls all need to die in a housefire. tl;dr- Neither subreddit understands (or, at the very least, is willing to admit) that there are shitty people who are men and shitty people who are women but in general, men are not shitty and are not the root of the world's problems, and women are not shitty and are not the root of the worlds problems. "
t3_1bk94x,c97fll5,"I don't like to eat the same thing every day - why should I have to dress or look the same way every day? I do admit it's unwise to sacrifice comfort for pleasing others, but you also please yourself. When I see someone fit on television and admire their dedication to a fitness routine and I achieve a comparable level of fitness - it's something I can feel happy about."
t3_1ayifp,c91z4wm,"Ending the relationship opened my eyes to a lot of things I had been lying to myself for so long, like I liked the idea of the relationship more than him as a person, and that was selfish and wrong. So yeah, without the failure of the relationship, I wouldn't be able to know so much about myself and admit my own social faults/strengths. Knowing this, we both come out of having a better understanding of who we are as people in relationships and who we would best get along with in relationships."
t3_34dp1h,cqtp0m2,"So, in summary, UKIP are bad news. However, I have to admit that I'm with them on hospital parking fees. ~~Edit: Well, it looks like OP has hit and and run."
t3_344wiz,cqras5q,"It does take more than a conversation to make a person realize another person's situation, but it is a starting point. Firstly: I'd be interested in hearing how it is you would suggest ""marketing"" this problem that you admit exists. Secondly: > a reality almost no one disputes when you get down to it: That white people have it better off in everyday social interactions Perhaps this is your experience, however there are many people who do deny this very fact."
t3_341qpv,cqqfavj,She the withholds sex as a control mechanism. On top of that she is gas-lighting him to admit he is wrong and should take the blame. She tells him there is no point in disagreeing because she has the control.

t3_32ml8o,cqcp6fe,"Even if we both agree that the standard in place isn't the best way to determine the quality of the teacher, the fact remains that these teachers subverted the primary means of overseeing teachers. Rather than admit they were incapable or put the effort in to avoid failure, they lied. That gets you forcibly ejected from any workplace I've ever heard of."
t3_2ymgjr,cpb1gj1,"First your basis of ""all things being reasonably equal"" is basically impossible, since two different businesses will always have different operating methods and costs. It seems to me that the one willing to admit that their pricing might not be as fair as they thought, and takes steps to remedy that is the better option. It's not that they're willing to be ""more reasonable,"" they're willing to admit they're wrong."

t3_2yd5o8,cp8vpwz,"Maybe they know their native country is shitty, but they don't take seriously any possibility that it's anything more than bad luck. Or maybe they know their native country is shitty, and admit the culture plays a role, but don't see why they shouldn't simply reap the benefits of their hosts' culture while despising it. You can make any of these five excuses, or maybe a lot more, but you can't say it's unreasonable for the hosts to think they should integrate, because it's not unreasonable to assume that immigrants have some serious reason for preferring the host country, that overall a large net influx of immigrants suggests the host country is systematically more successful in a way that the immigrants themselves appreciate, and that cultural differences do explain some differences between some countries."

And if those are reasonable things to think, then even though you don't have to agree with them, you certainly have to admit that there's nothing wrong with expecting immigrants to integrate, and that that expectation can be motivated by something other than racism. Even if it a native actually believed that all of the cultural differences between him and the potential immigrants were trivial and purely cosmetic , there is nothing wrong with having preferences between cultures."
t3_2wwm6s,cousnad,"Even if diseases evolve in such a way that our vaccines and antibiotics aren't effective anymore, why would we be worse-off in that case than we were before we had those tools in the first place? This is an appeal to present political circumstances, and I admit that those circumstances could change a lot over half a millennium. But I put it to you that they aren't likely to change in a way that challenges the point."
