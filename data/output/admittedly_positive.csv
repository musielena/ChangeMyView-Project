t3_2qb4ra,cn4kqwf,"If you can't sell auctions, this should still help. It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with. If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun."
t3_2ch2je,cjfeou6,"Except in Pokemon, those pets breath fire, shoot streams of pressurized water, and hurl bolts of lightning at each other, all at your command. So I would just say that it isn't valid to say Pokemon has no appeal because it is lacking in what are admittedly its weakest aspects. Every game is lacking in some way or another, but what makes it fun is how well its strong points make up for this."
t3_2c5zac,cjc9611,"ISIS may have captured some hardware we gave the Iraqi's but its not like they stormed Ft Bragg and took it. The US Military, admittedly strung out from over a decade of bullshit wars, remains unquestionably the strongest fighting force in the world. This makes the US #1 by the most important military metric."
t3_2apfnp,cixj7ex,"He WANTS to stop, but can't, he RECOGNIZES that what he is doing is self-harmful, but does it anyway. A person like that is engaged in an altruism (giving), yet he also (admittedly) acting against his interests (not self serving). "
t3_298qie,ciinvgt,"But your starting position was more akin to ""not queuing is always rude."" The ""small pass"" you gave to bars was admittedly ""sarcastic,"" because you view bars as ""places where politeness goes to die."" In fact you stated that ""This [not queuing] is a big problem in two places, bars"" Now you agree that non-queuing in certain types of bar may not be a ""big problem."""
t3_287cab,ci86zv4,"The editors asked him informally to change the form of the article and cut down on the end-matter, and Sokal refused. The only reason the (admittedly bad) editors didn't scrap the article entirely was because they were so excited that he was a leading scientist attempting (in bad faith, as it turns out) to bridge the gap. They sat on the article for a while until an issue on Science came out."
t3_25gqr3,chh8rrt,"As an aside, some consider the possibility of a cyclical universe that has periodic big bangs, then collapses in on itself and repeats. This would necessarily require a violation of the 2nd law of Thermodynamics (though admittedly the conditions of pre-big-bang universe have not been replicated in the lab). Furthermore, they don't line up with a universe that is accelerating outward."
t3_23xw5n,ch1nret,"I should've clarified in my original response that I didn't mean things offensive. (Okay, admittedly the first world problems thing was a bit sardonic. :)); I consider myself fortunate, reasonably, though not wealthy by American standards (I have a car made in a post-2010 year, albeit a Fiesta.)"
t3_20ndjd,cg50ewo,"The fact that it seems obvious to you isn't worth very much in practical terms. URL is admittedly not a very convincing source, but it does suggest that atheists are underrepresented in the prison system. If Christians are more likely to wind up in jail than atheists are, then it doesn't seem likely that religious faith consistently has the effect that you're ascribing to it."
t3_20er8m,cg2ldgv,"It could benefit you if your empathy for animals/other present and future people is a strong enough force to counteract the desire to eat meat. I know that Rand isn't the biggest fan of empathy as a rational motivation, but I am admittedly not sure how far she would take it. If there are limits to it, I don't see how not eating animals couldn't fit under her worldview for certain people and their desires."
t3_1y9b1n,cfim0mc,"Your view was that it's not possible to enjoy those bars, and it sounds like talking to a living counterexample to that view has changed that view. But stepping aside from the (admittedly narrow) scope of just trying to change your view, I don't mind expanding on why I like those bars. I'm not interested in determining whether or not it could be labeled as a social interaction."
t3_1we3gg,cf14aw0,"I think similar things could be said for pain and suffering of many kinds. Now, if I happen to pass on my condition, (which, admittedly, I would think differently of, if it were known to be fully genetic and not a combination of environmental and genetic influences) I won't be happy about it. I'm sure I'll feel horrible when I see them in pain the way I am."
t3_1qwdul,cdhd52x,"Which, for you, in your eyes may seem to be the PUA approach. I admittedly used a few PUA methods when I whored around, because some of them are actually common sense. The problem is the desired end goal."
t3_1pcykr,cd16k0g,"Sort of like how some people still believe we only use 10% of our brains at any given time. To address your two points, your recollection is admittedly hazy. Is it possible a flu shot caused muscular degeneration?"
t3_1mq464,ccbkgg8,It is complex and easily conflated with all sorts of other things. The fundamental point that combats racism is that there are no inherent superiorities or inferiorities due to race and that any admittedly factual discrepancies in rates of violence or what have you are not inherent and are actually due to external factors like socio-economic forces. People who conceive of a post-racial society are not wrong at the level of their idealism.
t3_1mdfzf,cc8qlw3,"There's been some very exciting work in the last decade or so that shows that the actual structure (size, density) brain regions can change due to experience. For example, there was the (admittedly correlational) study of URL . Fortunately, further studies came along and showed structural change with experimentally induced new activities, like URL , or URL ."
t3_1i0zds,cazx7qm,"This behavior characterized people who were out there militating for the right for your assimilationist friends to even consider their sexual orientation as something uneventful; it used to be something that made them criminals and moral deviants. As someone who admittedly is pretty assimilationist, I have to say that I disagree with your married friends. Flamboyant people don't bring shame to the gay community any more than they do to the straight community."
t3_1hajga,cass9ux,"Please give me something to work with with regards to what you're disagreeing with my comment, mach11, and simply dismissing things without giving any reason isn't productive to an exchange of views regardless the topic, and it shuts down any chance of changing one's view, which is the point of this subreddit if I'm not mistaken. :/ I attempted to be as exhaustive as my admittedly layman perspective allows me to be, addressing the various specific concerns one might have. You only listed a few things in your initial post, stating Your only data to proof you provided was that of the APFT which I addressed and did not dispute."
t3_1fzbuj,cafam2z,"Music is the exact same way, and what you consider unmusical noise is exactly the thing someone else gets a rush of adrenaline from. The ""everything can be done properly or badly"" approach: Vocals in death metal are, admittedly, not used the same way vocals are used in most other kinds of music. They provide a more rhythmic component and tie the instruments together."
t3_18dj9h,c8go2f3,"While I would agree that it is just as possible for a vegetarian diet to be healthy for most people, there are some that are physically required to eat meat. I have a friend that has an admittedly rare issue with anemia. While most anemics are able to take iron pills or consume plants that are rich in iron, her body doesn't process either of those sources correctly."
t3_33ltmy,cqm6ae9,"Imagine what they would do if they didn't have some type of oversight. If you're there making sure they're obeying the admittedly poor environmental standards, you'll be doing some good. You might feel that you could be doing more somewhere else, but at least you'll be providing for your family and yourself with the construction job."
t3_2y2tk3,cp5w6ub,"It's something that has been being discussed for a long time. Ferguson may have brought that into sharper focus, particularly the admittedly very strong images of police demonstrating very, very poor weapon control while attempting to deal with the protesters. (Compare URL with military police, who issue instructions URL and even while marching across Afghanistan URL .)"
t3_2uj4yv,co9ncgk,"Petty inter-state power squabbles happen all the time, and healthcare is not something I'm comfortable with them dragging into that muck. Education: This definitely meets the constitutional challenge for federal control, though it does admittedly rely on SCOTUS principles. Having an educated populace is a compelling government interest."
