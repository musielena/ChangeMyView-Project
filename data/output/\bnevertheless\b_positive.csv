t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,Their concepts have application for all biology however. I will note that there is some disagreement about these definitions but nevertheless they serve as a great/solid foudation upon which to build our ideas of life. Life must satisfy the following conditions in almost every case: 1. composed of cell/cells 2. organizatoin (think organs/organelles) 3. engage in metabolism (energy use) 4.
t3_29d178,cijpsrq,"We _cannot_ be thought of as the gatekeepers for valid people. I have worked with people with severe difficulties who were nevertheless brilliant, but I cannot predict if they'll do well in life in general. Only if they can calculate an integral."
t3_1uhj8f,cei5r73,"Suppose you are a brain-in-a-vat and the other people you see are just non-sentient simulations in the computer which are complex enough to pass the Turing test and fool you but basic enough to be non-sentient. The earlier point nevertheless still stands: your brain is experiencing a simulation, but there is still an outside world where your brain-in-a-vat is a physical object which surprisingly gives rise to consciousness. And if you are wiling to accept that surprising fact about your physical brain ""here"", hooked up to this simulating machine, then why not say the same of that other brain ""over there"" hooked up to another simulating machine?"
t3_1u3x0p,ceea3qy,"He keeps rigorous data on his operation, and his findings show that ""employees further up the corporate ladder cheat more than those down below"". Executives who can obviously afford a dollar for a bagel and 50 cents for a donut nevertheless refuse to pay, perhaps due to a sense of entitlement. Another study, linked in URL shows that a major motivation for stealing, apart from not having enough money or food, is the ""feeling of being deprived""."
t3_1t8yrt,ce5k8r6,"Suppose I concede that pirates reduce the studios' profitability, and that increased profitability would attract more studios and thereby lower prices/increase supply of movies. I think you need another step to show that it is nevertheless immoral to pirate. Example: carpoolers reduce car manufacturers' profitability."
t3_1ld6h6,cby2a8w,"It is also useful during trial to avoid ""fishing"". You may not be guilty of the crime you are charged with, but nevertheless not want to give information that incriminates you regarding other crimes (perhaps you are innocent of murder but don't want to go to jail for drug possession). Admittedly, this is less useful than the pre-trial uses described above."
t3_1kabrs,cbmzr37,"The OP is actually much more clever than you all are giving her credit for OP has only made a comment about what happens IF Batman can escape the first fight - so any crazy-powerful superbeing wins but is not relevant to the discussion. What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and become insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count) That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)"
t3_1e0dd7,c9vpu8l,"* Abusing/torturing said enemies of the state * And last but not least, invading other countries, knowing it to be the ""right"" thing to do And now your president is after murdering citizens without trial. People are rightly up in arms, but it's nevertheless quite telling that the ongoing murder of foreigners hasn't caused that much of a stink. The US is still a loooooooooong way from where the Third Reich was, but it's getting closer every year."
t3_1byb8b,c9bdajc,"Maybe. But you can think of lots of examples where someone puts themselves into a bad situation, but government nevertheless steps in to save them from themselves. If someone is drunk driving and gets in an accident, the EMT's don't say ""well, I guess they wanted to crash, so we should respect their wishes and leave them there""."
t3_2wfe25,coqawpy,"A lot of real heroes were people generally considered to be dicks and shit disturbers in their time but they were RIGHT and society was WRONG and we were better off for them fighting the system. There are also a lot of people that we don't like in society who it is, nevertheless, not right to punish. Maybe there is a yoga studio with a big front window looking in, I like to hang out across the street from a yoga studio at a coffee shop and watch the ladies do their thing as I have a coffee."
t3_2t6ote,cnw8hwh,"If no ""crime"" took place, why would the courts grant CPS custody? Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it must seem to make reports and nevertheless see these horrible excuses for parents take babies home to what will inevitably amount to shitty home situations. But 99% of the time, that caseworker doesn't want the child going home either - there just wasn't enough legal standing to keep them."
