t3_2rnr30,cnhz52y,"You have the legal right to defend it as opposed to work you would be defending yourself. Most workplaces as it stands, despite gun laws do not allow employees to carry while working. Carrying while working will usually result in a disciplinary action or immediate termination."
t3_2pod0t,cmyqnc7,"However, increasingly we are seeing income inequality become a problem around the world. The idea is that despite the social security system looking like its heading to its doom, as an increasingly prosperous nation, this shouldn't be a problem because when there are less people, the per capita wealth should go up, minimum wage should increase, and there shouldn't be as much need for social security. But this isn't what is happening and the average wealth is actually decreasing in relation to the cost of living."
t3_2pimzj,cmy635r,"I think a good anecdote has to do with losing religion. For a long time despite the evidence, or lack thereof, I used to defend my religion, using many types of mental gymnastics to get around it. I started out with a strong belief which got weaker and weaker till I both stopped believing and stopped following the rules of that religion."
t3_2p82u7,cmv90fo,Who's to say that someone's first principals aren't what most would consider evil or torturous? I imagine one could come up with philosophically 'pure' moral code which result in actions that you or I would likely consider 'bad' despite them being 'good' from the actors reasoning. 
t3_2p04r0,cmt3cpf,"From OP's post it is very evident he intends the latter. So OP states that people, despite being researched on a topic, are incorrectly assuming they are correct about some things in that topic. There are 2 fallacies here: that having spent more time on the topic makes a conclusion more likely correct (this is precisely an a argument from authority) and that people despite being researched are unable to form a correct conclusion or a valid conclusion (the ad hominem I was previously referring to)."

t3_2orvv0,cmq18ik,"We may as well be talking about the morality of marrying a blonde or a brunette, it's inconsequential to whether or not someone should or shouldn't be allowed to do them. It's not immoral for Koreans to eat dog meat despite it being distasteful to me as a westerner. I find it distasteful because I've had pet dogs and the idea of killing them for meat is distressing to me."
t3_2nokg9,cmfgdsv,"Morality is not an objective perspective, thus telling someone their values are immoral for reasons beyond their social or philosophical conduct is somewhat disingenuous. If someone's morals are built one the idea of 'not causing violence' then despite the outcome of the situation, and the logic behind the final result; using violence to justify later non-violence can also be seen as immoral. One would usually argue that 'there is another way' to get to the final result."
t3_2neyur,cmd1oh5,"However, this didn't happen in a vacuum. We know that URL despite equal usage rates. We know that Whites and Blacks violate traffic laws at roughly the same rate, yet Blacks are three times more likely to be pulled over."
t3_2n4aay,cmadd6m,"* Vomiting after all my meals or turning of all the lights on and off 600 times makes my life unmanageable, but I can manage with vomiting once a day and turning the lights on and off 5 times. Do I have a moral obligation to reduce the effect that either trigger has on me, despite the fact that doing so will make my life unmanageable? "
t3_2m9ifg,cm2cio0,"See: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/18r63h/does_reddit_protect_your_karma_totals_from_mass/ Given that fact, the way that people are acting in obeying the hive mind is not actually a function of the reddit karma system, but a misunderstanding of that system. I want to note that the way karma actually works makes what you are saying less true - despite widespread belief that karma is a simple sum.

t3_2lpxdl,clx2whc,"The Cold War thing may not apply then. ""The world is progressively getting worse"" is a sentiment that every generation seems to believe despite the world clearly being better now than possibly any point in history. Violent crime has been on a steady decline for decades."
t3_2l9paa,clsvj5h,"Those who tend to vote most frequently are those with extreme views. Tea Party candidates, for example, win despite being a small minority of Republican voters, because their candidates know the majority of people that disagree with them won't vote anyways, so the only need to worry about rallying the Tea Party. You vote so that for future elections, candidates know they must appeal to you too."
t3_2kko3q,clm9cuo,"In particular, resources in current democracies are allocated primarily through a capitalist system of unlimited private ownership and free trade. These private institutions are completely unelected and unaccountable despite having substantial power over society and culture. At that point the door is wide open for government corruption because systems of private power dominate society and easily manipulate government policy for their interests."
t3_2k08pw,clgq55q,"It would change my whole situation. There would be far too many people who'd give in, despite it not being what they want or need because of money incentives. "
t3_2j4t8g,cl8f03j,"Rhythmic gymnastics is very dancey, and it's in the Olympics. If golf is considered a sport despite no physical strain, then marching band can be turned into a sport too. Teams compete against each other, people judge their routines, they accumulate points, and a winner is determined."
t3_2j4t8g,cl8f03j,"In other words, pretty much anything can be turned into a sport if they can be judged and assigned points. Competitive eating can be a sport too despite no physical strain. Heck, curling has been reinstated as a sport back into the Olympics!"
t3_2j196u,cl7qbkn,"Rape victims are told that they did not make their objection clear enough, that they were inviting sex via certain behavior (being flirtatious, wearing certain clothing, etc.) despite their clear objections. Justice has been breached on so many occasions because rape victims' point of view has been ignored and excuses have been made to protect rapists."
t3_2ia687,cl0qx79,"Certainly, people that earn high wages have earned a fair degree of what they earn, but the question that's really being asked is ""how much did they earn?"" People don't just make money out of thin air, and despite what many will tell you, they certainly didn't make it ""on their own"". Public infrastructure and employees play a major part in any wealthy persons road to becoming wealthy."
t3_2ho91q,ckuhrou,"There's a difference between not standing in someone's way as they make a bad decision and actively helping them. If your friend wants to drop out of college despite having a decent GPA and no other prospects, do you say, ""I think that's a bad choice but it's your choice,"" or do you say, ""Here, I'll print out the paperwork for you?"" If your friend wants to marry someone you think is an abusive psycho, do you say, ""I don't think she's right for you but I hope I'm wrong,"" or do you say, ""Here, you can borrow my grandmother's ring to propose with."
t3_2fwmff,ckdfg3r,"However, the situation isn't quite that simple, because the wife gets lazy, depressed, whatever so the husband has to cover more for taking care of the kids, cleaning the house, etc. She starts drinking heavily because of her depression, and despite his attempts to get her to want to get help, she refuses and lashes out violently at him, even hitting him. By this point, he's basically a single dad with a roommate who lives in his house for free and helps with nothing but causes a lot of trouble for him and his children."
t3_2eahyl,cjxtave,"This is just yet another way though that a song can manage to end at the top of a song rather than the bottom of a song. I'm going to try and convince you further despite seeing that you've already had your view changed. Regarding your criticism of it's use in popular music in a stand-alone song and not theatrically or a transition, your view is that it seems out of place and lazy."
t3_2dtng7,cjsxvxf,"It should be possible to analyze your brain and predict what you are going to do next. If you still think you have free will despite of that, what makes you believe God ""omniscience"" doesn't exploit this fact? "
t3_2ck2yw,cjgci5s,"Chernobyl was the only one to result in fatalities, the radiation exposure from Fukushima was comparable to spending a week in Denver (high altitude), and Three Mile Island had no measurable health effects. URL data shows that nuclear power is the safest form of conventional energy in existence, despite the fact that we are using technology that is decades old. Nuclear energy seems to be more lethal because the deaths are not gradual, as they are with fossil fuels."
t3_2cimfd,cjfu9rt,"I will agree that it shouldn't make you 'king of the world', in and of itself. If a civilization still wins through a cultural victory, despite having a long history of military blunders or failures in foreign policy, it wouldn't make much sense to declare that person the ruler of everything unless the people interpreted that person as being some amazing, removed-from-reality, figurehead (something like a god). If that person is seen as this amazing and immortal being, other citizens of other countries may be so starstruck with that person's accomplishments that it overshadows the failures that person has had."

t3_2btxhq,cj8xbmk,"Now there are side effect of releasing SO2 into the atmosphere, but if the alternative is extinction, you don't think a single nation or a single billionaire wouldn't say, umm I'll deploy the SO2 aerosols. Ok lets assume you and Guy McPherson are right about the climate predictions and modeling and that a rise of 4 degrees C would cause a positive feedback loop that kills all of us despite all the evidence to the contrary. To accept this premise you must accept that humans are capable of substantially affecting the environment."
t3_2bmc2p,cj6qflr,"Israel essentially ""won"" in the 2008 Gaza war. Hamas continued to shoot rockets at Israel despite this. The response is disproportionate in an attempt to scare Hamas off and placate the Israelis within Israel that something is being done."
t3_2a7f52,cisf85e,"If you have a show with enough episodes chances are people will like it. For example anime like Naruto and DBZ have loads of fans despite having incredibly slow paced story-line. In my opinion i think appeal, art style and good music is enough for people to stick around to love it."
t3_29koa9,cilxj9y,"I believe this is the same for almost every sport. This, a lot of your post is based on this despite you not being aware of it. Soccer is filled with stratergy and I think you just need to watch a bit more of it to become accustomed to it."
t3_29koa9,cim79ff,"Every shot looked like it could be a goal and even Howard the GK went up to attack - it was mad. Unfortunately you're out though, despite Tim Howard being absolutely world class. "
t3_28wpvg,cif9t6k,"Would you object to this name? I would, despite being an atheist. It denigrates an entire group of people."
t3_28wp3q,cif88e5,"I'm not going to dive into the dangers of anecdotal data because others have covered that, but I want to point out that the study you're citing is actually really bad for your point: 1) it doesn't suggest that women place a larger emphasis on looks, just that they find a large number of men below average in terms of appearance. If most women continue to date despite finding men unattractive, that suggests appearance actually doesn't matter that much to them. If appearance was the primary characteristic for women and they find 80% of men unattractive, services like OkCupid would go bankrupt."
t3_28jnxp,cibmdqw,"Each. Perfectly legal to possess in their current state, but $50 in parts (which are also perfectly legal to own) without submitting the tax stamp application would make me a felon, despite having done nothing to threaten society. Your entire premise is that once a felon, always a rampant menace to society."
t3_28b0tb,ci9lccd,"But again, this could be remedies by the 'overseas experience' that Australians and Kiwis do. Most of your points apply equally to Canadians yet I meet a similar number of Canadians in London to Americans despite the population of American being roughly ten times that of Canada. Your points about distance and time/money also apply to New Zealand and Australia."
t3_26uqns,chur6nz,"I think that there is. The means of accomplishing the settlement of Israel may seem harsh but at the benefit of less bloodshed despite conflicting interests, I think it's just. "
t3_24c1q3,ch5ursh,"Pubes are natural, but we have found a reasonable alternative that meets a variety of needs at little to no cost. TL;DR: You shouldn't be made to feel like a creep for wanting pubes, but you should get why pubes are no longer the societal default despite still being the natural default. I think one thing has been overlooked."
t3_2360o1,cgtsaaa,"Major universities have de facto quotas for asian students to ""preserve the brand."" People from underprivileged asian groups (such as cambodians and hmong) receive little attention and support because they are lumped into the successful asian paradigm despite having among the highest levels of poverty. The traits that make a white man seem dominant in a business environment are disliked when displayed by asian men because it doesn't fit the expectation of how they are supposed to act (eg quiet and submissive)."
t3_22p8vc,cgp2qt7,"As these cultures often change upon extended exposure to other cultures, we cannot assume that these people are genetically predisposed to different social constructs, rather that their social constructs were created parallel to we believe to be the norm. Europe has many countries that have very distinct cultures despite a great deal of cultural interactions, similar genetics, and similar resources and climates. If culture were largely genetically predetermined, these cultures would be far more homogenous."

t3_21006g,cg8jacm,"He could point out how often scales figure into his music, both explicitly and implicitly. He could tell her that, although the Western tradition is not the only musical system in the world, he believes it is the most beautiful and that, because she will have exposure and training in this tradition from a young age, she can be free later in life to combine that training with any number of other influences, and that, even if she decides that Oriental or African music is better, despite being jarring to her father's Western sensibility, at least she was able to make an informed choice. Rather than let her reinvent the history of music, her father is pointing her to the geniuses who already did all the hard work."
t3_1zj8xe,cfuptvj,"Honestly, I think they'd probably be insulted and take it personally and would be more likely to take positions at other schools that had no such requirement. And while maybe it wouldn't be universal, I would suspect most people would prefer to be taught by the best and the brightest despite their accents over some pretty smart guys that speak clearer English. I would predict that that school would lose considerable prestige."
t3_1y7dly,cfi99ou,"The assessments now say more about the thing being assessed than the individual. There's something about murder that makes it bad, despite perhaps not being to objectively quantify why. (to the reader: please don't try to objectively describe why murder is wrong, that's not the point here)."
t3_1vitnu,cet1d7h,"I'd agree, strictly speaking, if you're trying to pass someone a quick note to communicate something, it's only important that the message be clear enough to communicate your point. I noticed that you made many mistakes in your post, and I didn't mind at all, despite working as an editor. Just know that there's a lot to be said for correct usage and proper grammar, and know that you communicate more with your speech and writing than just your words and their intended effect."
t3_1sbxik,cdvzn8z,"I don't think we do? I realize that people like to consider themselves pro-life despite the exceptions to rape and incest, but if all that mattered was whether a fetus was a person, we wouldn't have those exceptions. The fact that someone did not consent to sex does not rebut the 'fact' that, once conceived, that fetus, according to a pro-lifer, is a person."
t3_1rzqrw,cdsigu7,"Do you believe you have any obligation to future generations? If so, environmental protection may help many human beings despite the fact that the human race will be wiped out at some point in time. Whether that takes place in a eighty years or eighty billion years, there are people whose lives will be improved if you take care of the environment."
t3_1rvjrs,cdre1mt,"While testing, all testers were clean-shaven and dressed in a similar manner (appropriate for the interviews). Dr. Pager's team found that white applicants were about twice as likely to be called back for the position, despite everything else about the applicants being normalized. They were able to get the results to equal out by varying the applicant's background; white applicants whose records showed that they had been convicted of a felony were about as likely to get a positive response as were black or hispanic applicants whose record showed that they had never been convicted of a crime."
t3_1pv4f2,cd79owh,That's a problem that contributes to real harm to real people - and is bigger than just 'offending people'. The fact that you can deal with jokes about suicide despite having a close connection with it is a testament to the extent of your limits. And that's fine.
t3_1prkvt,cd5p13p,People do turn to crime. However in the USA crime rates have been dropping despite increases in wealth inequality. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_US_Gini_Coefficient_for_Household_Income_(1967_-_2007_).png This graph represents inequality: the higher the gini is the higher income inequality is.
t3_1ppyu1,cd4u21e,"An Antagonist is a character that opposes the protagonist. It is irrelevant what significance the protagonist or antagonist have to the narrative, the protagonist could be someone who just witnesses caos unfold and reacts to it, despite not having any influence of the situation. So clearly, Ned is the main protagonist of season 1."
t3_1pbxrs,cd0uwwl,"It is frustrating that even though vaccines are highly effective, very inexpensive, have minimal side effects, have been rigorously tested, and have saved billions of lives, people who don't understand even the basics of medicine will refuse them because they are afraid. For example, people are afraid of autism, but instead of trying to find the root cause, they simply blame vaccines, despite the fact that the only person why has ever suggested that they were responsible was proven to be a liar and a fraud. It's possible that the HPV vaccine has some deadly side effects that we don't understand yet, but right there is no scientific evidence that it does."
t3_1otp1b,ccvi2vt,"Most people agree that they're some of Pixar's worst movies. (They're not terrible - they're just not as good) They get a disproportional amount of criticism though, because despite being some viewed as the worse in Pixar's selection, they are some of the most profitable, and people hate that. So they gets more criticism than they might deserve."
t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"Right now, yes, there have been episodes of violence worldwide since the second world war, but the sum total of armed conflict from the end of Second World War to now represents a small fraction of what either world war was. In essence, despite the existence of armed conflict still in the world, we are in a period of relative peace that has been enforced first by US and Soviet power, and since the fall of the soviet union, by US hegemony. Put more simply, people have, for the most part, made the decision to actively not be killing each other on extreme scales because there have been international superpowers capable of wiping them off the planet with relatively minimal effort."

t3_1o1ids,cco1eoy,"Sure, I can ask you to try the olives, but if you really don't like the taste no amount of arguing about the consistency, texture or flavor is going to convince you otherwise. At this point, what you have is two people facing off against each other when in reality I should just be able to accept that you dislike olives, or think there may be a god, or lean libertarian and still be good friends with you despite those things because I enjoy your company. Sometimes two people have just exhausted the depth of their knowledge in a debate, and all that is left is both sides' preferences."
t3_1nichn,cciuejb,"I challange you view that there is no such a thing as a waste of money. What if despite all your spending on education, the schools are still crummy and the teachers still horrible? how about if all the money spent on science doesn't produce the breakthroughs you are expecting, will there be any accountability on how the money spend?"
t3_1mjw31,cc9yys4,"One final point - there have even been studied that suggest that knowing the ending can enhance one's enjoyment of a story. That despite the near unanimous hatred of spoilers they actually can make a story better. Unfortunately I'm on my phone so it's hard for me to find links, but I can look then up when I get the chance (if you or someone else doesn't Google them first)"
t3_1mdfzf,cc88r54,"Unlike many of the fields you mention, there's no clear biological reason why it should be heavily gendered: the work is creative, non-dangeorus, non-physical, often involves story-telling, and the job itself is overwhelmingly based on communication. And despite this, game design has a 90-10 split, on par with construction workers. I would argue, in this example, that the split has heavily to do with sexism, both in a medium that consistently outputs sexist drivel that turns off women, and in an industry plagued by ingrained sexism."
t3_1lpsaf,cc1k8vm,"I've seen some of the smartest people I ever knew amount to nothing because they refused to put in any work and some people I thought weren't intelligent do well because they worked hard (of course YMMV). And yes, there will always be savants who can do anything without even trying, but there will also be idiots who got lucky despite a lifetime of laziness, but these people are the outliers. "

t3_1kdvro,cbnxode,"It was in a totally obnoxious voice, A hated the guy and hated that he did that.

t3_1jzymk,cbk02iw,"I also want to point out that there is a SERIOUS lack of women in STEM fields. The percentage of female graduates in computer science, for example, is abysmal and is actually getting worse despite the special scholarships (side note: men can get scholarships too if they bother to look for them and fill out applications). Considering that technology is one of the fastest growing research and industrial fields, it doesn't really matter that more women graduate than men."
t3_1jzymk,cbk165v,"There were times when I would have the right answer and be ignored for an hour until they figured it out themselves. It was incredibly frustrating not to be taken seriously as an academic despite my comparable grades and working knowledge of the subject matter.

t3_1h4fc4,car011b,"Why does everyone think that Snowden's information indicates that the U.S. government is reading your e-mail?

t3_1edggu,c9z8w9e,"Sometimes I still feel like I don't deserve to be alive or be happy or loved because of those experiences, but as I've gotten older I've gotten better at controlling those feelings and the behaviors that come with them. I've learned to love my body, despite the fact that others don't always love or accept it. I still don't think it's ok for others to judge me based on what I look like, but I also don't need people to be ok with my body any more."

And despite popular belief, they are pretty damn reliable at producing energy. Solar can still produce a lot of energy when it's cloudy out, and if you build wind turbines high enough, you can pretty much always get a breeze."
t3_1cfa2w,c9gqiud,"Free energy in the trash!). Now that oil is hardly cost effective anymore, we're starting to see some funds trickle in despite HEAVY resistance from entrenched actors in the production and sale of fossil fuels, and the increases in efficiency we're getting are incredible already!

t3_1bwu2v,c9auie0,"[1] I say ""one"" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics. [2] Example: the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black, despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people. All things being equal, you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white (not only are whites the majority, but they use pot more frequently)."
t3_1bitj0,c978xo7,"There was a lot more than met the eye when I first when to a rager in my first semester. My main reasons for leaving: One, despite the close friendships I saw forming all around me, I somehow didn't manage to make many deep connections. I was happy for those who did, but I ended up making friends with people outside the frat."
t3_34ew6y,cqtzmoj,"Exceptionally ambitious Indians move to America, because moving to America is hard and scary. It shouldn't be surprising that them and their children are unusually successful, despite hurdles of racism and discrimination. If they were going to have an average reaction to those hurdles, they wouldn't have overcome all the extra hurdles that come with immigration, and would still be in their home countries."
t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"(i know this last question is scaremongering so just ignore it if you like) If you don't mind, im going to try and change your view by looking at some of the policies you mention (which, despite my disagreement, are legitimate policies) and by trying to explain some of the more structural issues with the party. So Nigel Farage is obviously a well worded and rather charismatic fella."
t3_344wiz,cqre4xb,"With each passing generation you can erode racism, sexism, etc and make people aware of the existence of these things and how to identify them simply by exposing young people to the concepts. Ive seen this first hand growing up in the south where, in a conversation with one of my friends conservative white father, he called his daughter's boyfriend the n word; he at least cares enough for her not to do it in front of them, but the point is that despite his best efforts he was unable to pass that view onto his daughter evidenced by the fact that she was dating (and having sex with) a black guy. "
t3_33txti,cqooew0,"If people do use the word racism to describe non-""prejudice + power"" scenarios, how to others tend to react? If in practice it is met with resistance, hostility and debate, was the idea that was meant to be conveyed really clearly communicated, or did the word, despite it being ""technically correct"" create an argument when there didn't need to be one? "
t3_30rc1i,cpv3a8v,"We have gender roles, we have gender expression, we have physical characteristics, in other words, we have a ton of external gender markers, but ultimately those markers don't matter. A drag queen does a great deal to look as close to a woman as possible, but still identifies as male, despite overhauling their physical appearance, at least temporarily. On the other hand, a trans woman is still a woman even if they haven't been able to transition for whatever reason, and physically appear to be still male."
t3_306jm9,cppkw7s,"Now, it's possible you don't believe what they are saying, but that is what they are saying. ""I'm not worthy, thank you, I'll try not to let it go to my head, to stay humble, to keep my feet on the ground despite all these wonderful accolades."" That's what it means to say ""I feel humbled."""
t3_2xavrb,coyhdb9,"The only time I see reviewers overlook a game's issues is when it's an online problem. For example, Battlefield 4 and the Masterchief collection got great reviews despite having virtually unplayable online modes. That's an issue that reviewers should be addressing."
t3_2td8d4,cny3yi2,"The prosperity of the ""first world"" western nations was greater than the prosperity of the ""second world"" communist nations, but all these countries did better the ""third world"" nations. In other words, communist China did better than so many of the earth's countries, despite having far less capitalism, so it's hard to believe capitalism is this great panacea. Rather, technological progress is responsible for all the things you ascribing to capitalism."
