t3_2qb4ra,cn4kqwf,"It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with. If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun. It's like playing poker with players who never bet: it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog."
t3_2q388d,cn2e6rz,"And that on its own creates a downside to torture - it will tarnish the reputation of the US, whether or not it is rationally justified. Many people are very uneasy with utilitarian calculations in which people's lives or health are deliberately sacrificed, even when inaction could be far more damaging (search ""The Trolley Problem"" for a hypothetical example). So whether or not these people are right to object to this use of torture, they will, and you have to consider that when weighing the pros and cons."
t3_2p0lop,cmsb4pj,"so policies would just be a constant to and fro swing in accordance to the immediate popular mood, to no helpful effect

 a great many people are already not welly informed or interested in politics. and look how in our current system we have companies and advertising campaigns pushing people to vote for a particular candidate, even when that candidate maybe doesn't represent the interests of the people very well, and how the people are so readily convinced to vote for them anyway. so instead of advertising for a candidate that will pass bills in their favor, companies will just advertise the bill itself directly to the people in the same way, essentially changing nothing and giving them the same, if not more sway than they already have."
t3_2n8psp,cmbnpay,"Nobody really replaces anybody, for me. Heartbreak at losing a lover still hurts just as badly, even when another lover is right there to comfort me. Getting a new lover doesn't replace the old at all, it's just another person, just as getting a new friend doesn't replace a lost best friend."
t3_2mptvb,cm6m7jr,"And would you want to keep up that ""alpha"" behavior yourself to keep that type of woman? Because it sounds like you do still want to find someone who likes you as a person, and you're not actually getting much enjoyment even when changing your behavior pays off in hookups. The problem is, finding someone who can really connect with you and love you for who you are is a hard thing to do, for everybody."
t3_2j7ldo,cl9jwrv,"Now, here's the twist ending: This is not unusual for me doing my job. I have plenty of clients who know me by name, who ask me how my day is going even when I'm not working with them, and who, as far as I can tell, to some degree enjoy my company, and I enjoy theirs. Now, I'm not some super-social creature who goes around mingling; I'm extremely shy outside of work and the internet."
t3_2il5rb,cl3468o,"And with brains, we've been able to hone our ability to focus and concentrate, remove ourselves from distractions. To some degree, you've done this yourself, even when the distracting factor is sexually attractive. But suppose I'm wrong, that it's just physically impossible for us ignore sexually appealing distractions."
t3_2i9k8i,cl0eukd,"But a law can applied consistently and fairly without being a fair law. The US (or any country) passes laws that benefit people unequally, even when they are applied to everyone. For example, if you pass a law against sleeping under bridges, that only hurts people who were poor enough that they might want to sleep under bridges."
t3_2gliyk,ckk9blv,"Originally, this read in a way that made the waste seem negligible, and I don't want it to!) To an extent, fear is a problem as well - cold war attitudes still make people think that ""nuclear"" means ""extremely dangerous"", even when the technology has gotten much safer. This is very prevalent in America, from what I've seen."
t3_2fdmwl,ck87ud9,"For many, the process and history behind a piece is as important as the piece itself. That's why museums are filled with both original pieces - even when you can just print the image on google - and people coming to see them - even if they could just google it. Sure, the actual Mona Lisa isn't always on display, yet its the illusion of seeing the actual painting - that isn't extraordinary in itself - with all the history behind it that brings crowd to the Louvre."
t3_2eufa6,ck31w2x,"Especially if you're a professional or executive - your life does get scrutinized. Being asexual is still considered weird, and often times thought to be a cover for some darker sexual proclivities, even when it's not. I understand that people who have relationships have to deal with leaving those relationships too."
t3_2daht6,cjno02h,"I watched a man pour his heart out to a young slacker to try and get him to embrace life and potential in Good Will Hunting . I watched a man try to keep joy in the life of others, even when the joy is ripped from his own life in Patch Adams . I watched a man literally go through Hell to reunite a family in What Dreams May Come ."
t3_29koa9,cilvgjv,"That said what do you expect them to do? When a player goes down, even when they know it wasn't a foul, their best course of action is to try and get the foul because they've lost possession at that point. Not saying I like it either, but the players do it because it works often enough to be worth it."
t3_273kmd,chx2u1h,"Unfortunately, at your age and apparently in your social group, you are only exposed to the idiots. In most adult groups it is perfectly normal for a few people to drink little, or nothing, even when they normally do. People have to drive home, people have to go home and look after their children, people are on medications, are pregnant, have work in the morning, have work directly after the social event, etc."
t3_26p8jo,cht981c,"Except, if you are smoking every day then you never recover from even the short term effects and they become permanent in practice, until you stop. And even when you stop for daily smokers it often takes many months until you are completely unimpaired again. Last but not least, cannabis is a drug you will enjoy a lot more if you smoke it only occasionally (few times per year)."
t3_24v147,chbavh7,"Addition/overuse. Have you ever been near people who constantly check their phones, even when their phone hasn't audibly or physically notified them of some new message? You know, the people who always have their phone out, be it on a school desk or lunch tray or whatever."
t3_24fjg2,ch7503g,"If we work together, we can see to it that we live more comfortable and fulfilling lives, but we must first agree to not kill each other or take each other's stuff. That's the basis for all moral systems, even when they claim otherwise. Our ability to work together depends entirely on how I perceive you to keep me in consideration, and how you perceive me to keep you in consideration."
t3_245y6b,ch3yug9,"The other part is their entrenched bushiness model really doesn't mesh with the idea of them becoming replacement mainstream ISPs for large numbers of people, and they don't exactly have much motivation to change that. Their current business model is working pretty well, and established businesses are pretty resistant to fundamental changes when things are going well (and even when they're not--there's a lot of academic studies on this, and if you ever take a graduate level class on entrepreneurship and especially technology entrepreneurship you'll probably learn about some of them). I definitely agree mobile speeds will increase, though."
t3_23vvzm,ch1f49t,"I know that in my experience (both as a student and a teacher), nearly every obstacle a student might run into while learning the English language can be solved through more reading. Nearly all students who struggle in English are not readers in their free time (and are rarely readers even when their grade depends on it) and the students who do well in English classes are usually habitual readers. You also seem to be deeply underestimating how large a role rhetoric plays in the typical American public school."
t3_21eskl,cgcdlrz,"But they will be in even deeper poverty, and much more likely to be sociopathic criminals ready and willing to do whatever it takes to survive, because that's how children without a support network best survive to become adults. Children are resilient and quite likely to survive with zero government support anyway, even when their parents are in abject poverty. History is in fact full of kids who did just that."
t3_208uz9,cg0wdz0,"I could write thousands of words on this topic, so I'll just restrict myself to rebutting your particular points. Why do you trust whomever is in charge to keep the best interests of the country at heart, even when they conflict with personal interests? What do you do if you genuinely believe that they are not fit to rule?"
t3_1yoc2s,cfmqd96,"* The person's body produces a large amount of testosterone. However, these are only coincidentally true, even when they do hold. I could conclude that they are so, but only tentatively, and to be discarded if alternative evidence comes up, without discarding the premise that the person is male."
t3_1xne0t,cfcwnyo,"Finally finally (my last finally was lying), just because you believe it to be immoral, when there is no science backing up that the embryo/zygote is ~~human~~ a person, doesn't mean that we are forced to believe the same way you are, therefore legislating as such is unethical and unconstitutional, at least in America. I would debate this; no birth control method is 100% effective, even when adjusted for perfect use. There's still 1 chance in 1000 that a condom will fail if used properly."
t3_1wk9g4,cf2sjrm,"While it is true that the vast majority of suicides can be linked to some sort of diagnosable mental disorder, it is also true that URL . Furthermore, URL even when controlling for mental illness. Given that a) most people with a mental illness do not die by suicide, and b) mental health differences do not account for the differences in suicide susceptibility between gun-owning and non gun-owning households, we shouldn't needlessly restrict non-dangerous people from owning firearms."
t3_1wjgnr,cf2lmf3,"Why is 'happiness' the ultimate goal anyway? What if someone is unhappy for 51% of their life, but even when they aren't happy they are doing rad shit and they are REALLY happy 49% of the time? What does 'happiness' even mean in this context?"
t3_1wh80m,cf1x8sz,"You are partially correct, some of the differences between male and female wages can be explained by the factors you mentioned, such as occupation choice or number of years in the field. However, even when studies control for such factors, pay gaps are still readily apparent. For example, a study out of Stanford found that while occupation,industry, and years of experience do explain some of the disparity, even after this was controlled for, 40% of the pay gap could not be explained by these types of ""traditional"" factors."
t3_1ut0dy,celqez5,"It is mostly being funded by government. Anyway, there are currently many ongoing efforts that all advance our level of space technology, even when they don't really mean to. They are all small stepping stones that we can use later to build the space colonies we're dreaming of!"
t3_1scbek,cdw35c5,"For example you said you can ""follow your passion."" What if one day you found you just felt nothing, even when doing something you used to enjoy? What would you do then?"
t3_1qwg8s,cdhe2ys,"I have personally learned a few ways to defuse this situation, but it is very easy to get defensive and start countering this attack. In most cases the aggressor will then decide that the vegan is the one who is being aggressive and preachy, even when they were ones who instigated the argument in the first place. "
t3_1qfo09,cdcc9fw,"It would therefore be unconstitutional to deny them the right to wed. Well, first, there's the more practical side of it: Civil Unions are not universally administered, and, even when they are, they're not universally recognized. There are states that refuse to recognize even Civil Unions as valid, let alone companies."
t3_1o8avl,ccpruq6,The most popular piece of evidence is a study done on twins. Identical twins are much more likely to be gay if the other one is gay than fraternal twins -- and the trend holds up even when identical twins are separated at birth. This controls for environmental factors extremely well and shows that their genetics do have a huge component to play in their sexuality.
t3_1new3z,cci2yao,"There is a hierarchy. Rule is imposed upon those further down, even when those ruled didn't have a say in the rules. Contrast that with a system in which people can directly involve themselves in every decision."
t3_1lilfq,cbzpf1j,"Anyone can dress up, but it takes a certain keenness of mind to dress really well . Understanding a dress code and dressing appropriately accomplishes several things: 1) It signals an ability to follow and understand rules even when they are unstated . That is, by dressing appropriately, you show a respect for and willingness to join in the culture of the workplace."
t3_1kmwmn,cbqml03,"And the results are infrequently good. This is the case even when the underlying ideas behind the revolution are good ones. The French Revolution is a classic example: the ideals behind it were to become the cornerstone of the political philosophies that were a major driving force in the transformation of Europe from a viper's nest of repressive, warring monarchies to a peaceful continent of functional democracies."
t3_1k2ucr,cbl0joo,"I like to think that Love is something that is built. Sometimes you will feel it, and sometimes you may not, but that doesn't mean that what you've built isn't still there, so you have to make the effort to love your SO even when it's not the first thing you feel; you have to respect your Love. You mention in one of your posts that the kind of passionate love that people ""fall into"" is fleeting."
t3_1ied1a,cb3rv5u,"So much of these discussions are steeped in emotions and triggers that it's hard to know what effect what you say or do will have. You're right that many women will falsely but understandably generalize men even when you're trying to be an ally; but you must realize that what they're doing in this instance is creating a safe space themselves so that they can see the world the way the need to. Yes there is justified anger behind it and it may direct itself towards the nearest representation of the thing being fought (unfortunately you in this case, OP) but you have to accept that it is not your fault, and if you're an ally it never will be, but as the privileged party it is your responsibility to learn the triggers for yourself and accept the anger and feelings of people who have been constantly hurting for a great deal of their lives."
t3_1idtun,cb3jcue,"I.E. : Fossil fuels can provide power even when the sun is down and the wind isn't blowing. It's impractical to store grid power in a battery because it's too expensive: there's a 30-to-70% loss to heat for the charge/discharge cycle, and a battery that could store a night's worth of power for a medium city would be enormous (as big as a sports stadium) and expensive."
t3_1gjdzq,caks2pc,"People believe law is good and therefore they follow it. Now, if gold is only considered the ""real"" value behind money (initially) because of belief in its value, the parallel argument in the sense of law is that even when the government forces its law on people through violence, it can still only exist as law as long as people believe in its legitimacy. Now, this legitimacy can be produced by violence, but still the rule of law is contingent on the internalization of the law by people."
t3_1g8tam,cahvvfw,"If you work 60h/week, 50 weeks a year, that's the equivalent of being paid $1.73/h. The average hourly wage for undocumented workers are around $3.75/h, that's more than double what they make at home even when you factor in higher cost of living. It's closer to tripple if you don't factor in cost of living."
t3_1f5j5p,ca7fgce,"And people adjust unconsciously, to what they're used to. Old habits... And so even in real life, I get treated like a woman, even when that makes zero sense, and people aren't even aware of how gendered the way they treat people really is. Even by other women."
t3_1e1yw5,c9wdtql,"When I'm scheduling brainwave recording sessions, I need to know with absolute certainty that the person I hired to help me collect data is not going to sleep through their alarm, miss their bus for the second time this week, lose their grandmother for the third time this year, drop out of contact all weekend because they're getting drunk, etc. A high GPA tells me that someone is willing to prioritize the work that they promised to do, even when it gets boring or they don't feel like it or it interferes with their social plans. I can see why real employers might care about that as well."
t3_1dx9dj,c9ut84g,"Politicians keep their voting constituency in mind in everything they do. When they campaign, when they vote, hell even when deciding where to go for dinner. The one thing politicians care about more than power, money, or fame, are voters."
t3_1cymw8,c9l9z8j,"When taken as a whole, Christianity, whether true or not, provides more comfort than atheism. That's part of its appeal and part of what makes giving it up so painful for so many people, even when they start questioning whether it is true or not. "
t3_1c9rnm,c9efq9f,"I think we could improve on this statement a bit. One motivation for being vegetarian or vegan is that you are concerned with the rights of others, even when those others are non-human. The question then is ""what rights do people and animals have?"""
t3_1bk94x,c97fb32,"I think a lot of woman do it to feel better about themselves or for fun, not to impress men. A lot of women wear makeup even when they aren't going out or when there's no men around. Also, I suffer from Awfully low self esteem and self confidence, but still don't wear makeup."
t3_1b5h4r,c93tvyq,"The people who go to that group are already in an emotionally and socially vulnerable position in which speaking up in front of people who oppose them could be not only absolutely traumatizing in itself, but also potentially life devastating. On this same train of thought, many groups have such a history of being oppressed or abused by another group that this fear becomes omnipresent even when an individual has not been openly and directly threatened or abused. For instance, URL shows that women are 75% less likely to speak up in a space when outnumbered by men."
t3_341qpv,cqqfavj,"The 'treat me like a lady' line would be referring to using a set of gendered stereotypes about how a 'woman' should be treated, and have a foundation in sexist thinking. On top of that she deserves this sexist deference even when she is being unreasonable. On it's own I would give this a pass."
t3_32hrcu,cqbf680,"It's intuitively satisfying to believe that you can know what a small, isolated mistake tells you about a person, but that doesn't mean that it's true. The problem is that, as a general rule, we all consider ourselves good judges of character even when there's no real basis for that belief. It's intuitively satisfying to believe that you can know what a small, isolated mistake tells you about a person, but that doesn't mean that it's true."
t3_2zpo9g,cplrjw9,"Gerrymandering. This allows Representatives to be very safe in their bids for reelection and even when challenged, it typically means they have to move farther left or right--not toward the center--to appeal to their very left/right wing districts. 3."
t3_2ymgjr,cpax7jo,"It would be pretty crazy from a retailer POV to sell an item that people will buy for $100 at $70 just because the store could offer the item at $70. Another way of looking it is that people who are happy enough with the price not to do any research and comparison shop are able to happily pay said price, and those who either aren't happy with the price (for whatever reason, like say, a limited income) and thus comparison shop or those who are savvy enough to comparison shop even when they could afford the normal price get a lower price. This isn't such a bad arrangement, is it?"
t3_2xi4wd,cp0ef5z,"But I would say that you should at least decide what you think is the right amount of phoning, visiting, etc. to maintain the relationship and stick to that plan even when it might seem inconvenient. If there's consistency to it, they will get used to the new normal."
t3_2x8d5x,coxvk7s,"This is true, but not necessarily in the way you say. The reason why it (a) took us so long to even come up with quantum physics and (b) it's so hard to understand even when we know the math is that, at a macroscopic scales, quantum effects cancel each other, and only show up in specific circumstances (very roughly). I could say that I used quantum mechanics to displace the potential barriers of an object using my mind to make a pencil levitate, and it would be somewhat true."
t3_2uh710,co8twl0,"That's easily enough to pay for a cable and smartphone bill. So it's simply not the extra necessities that are breaking family's budgets, because the costs of all necessities have decreased dramatically, even when you include the new ones. So why is it so hard to support a family today on a single income compared to previous decades, especially given that it was more expensive to do so then?"
t3_2sohga,cnrg4rd,And her cut of that was not inherently unreasonable. Few if any CEOs become billionaires from their pay packages (even when you add in all the stock options and whatnot). People generally become billionaires by building businesses or other valuable things.
t3_2s5c4b,cnna15c,"Once again, the satire was not focused at random benign cultural differences (look at the Muslim wearing a rag for a hat, isn't he stupid), it was pointed at specific differences that were objectively harmful and unjust. Satire that targets harmful and unjust things remains noble even when it is crass. It deserves protection, and we should be outraged at what happened."
