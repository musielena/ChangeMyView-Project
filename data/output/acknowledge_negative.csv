t3_2rnfn0,cnhjtqq,It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. The first just says it's all Mary's fault.

t3_2qia6o,cn6ot0g,"Given the inputs (thousands of applicants) and the desired outputs (hire one person), its awfully hard for me to imagine a paradigm where you're not allowed to short-list a candidate who you have good reason to believe is a strong candidate. Whatever benefits to social mobility you think such a hypothetical paradigm shift would bring, I hope you at least acknowledge what a massive burden this would be. I think you also need to acknowledge how subtle ""networking"" can be."

I think you also need to acknowledge how subtle ""networking"" can be. Certain forms seem benign to the point of it being absurd to try to regulate them."
t3_2qia6o,cn7hii7,"Meanwhile, the disadvantaged folks who have already proven themselves as excellent employees have the connections they've built nullified and are sent into the pile full of carefully manicured resumes. If you want to dispute the advantage that already well-off folks have in resume writing and interviewing on the grounds that these are just skills that anyone could learn, then I feel like you have to acknowledge that networking is also a skill that anyone can learn. "
t3_2osnqc,cmresyd,We haven't cut down homophobia to record low levels by talking less about gay people- we talk about them more now. We celebrate queer culture and we acknowledge that all gender and sexual orientations are legitimate and deserve equal rights. I think that the solution to racism is similar- acknowledging black/latino/indigenous/asian/etc.
t3_2nxt7j,cmi28ac,"If so, then yeah, that's a naive view to have. But I think you can be ""pro-life"" and still acknowledge exceptions. I consider myself a man of peace, but there are things I would kill for."
t3_2lxha7,clz2zlh,"Take it from me, being trans sucks. At least if I were intersexed, my parents (and society) wouldnt have carelessly assumed one way or the other: they would, hopefully have been considerate enough to acknowledge my ambiguous status and let me come into my own as one sex or the other. It would have been a million times more preferable to grow up with a ""choice"" than being forced into the wrong box."
t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"Although technically I am Caucasian, on legal documents I always put down that I am Hispanic given the option. Not because I don't think I'm Caucasian, but because I identify with being Hispanic, and I want my government to acknowledge that. It isn't about skin color or race, it is about identity."
t3_2hr4br,ckv9shg,"Do you think we have complete knowledge of the genetic factors that could cause schizophrenia? You acknowledge that we know about some genetic factors that show a probability for someone having schizophrenia, but are you ruling out further discoveries that could find a direct causal link between a genetic factor and schizophrenia? What do you mean by ""caused""?"
t3_2gea6k,ckicnlx,"I might as well have burst into flames right there. She saw me, dirty and raggedy, and already came to the conclusion that I was just a dirty, raggedy, good for nothing person that didn't deserve to even be acknowledged. She let us through with lips so pursed they turned white."
t3_2gea6k,ckicnlx,"She let us through with lips so pursed they turned white. On the way out, she very politely said goodbye to my friend, and didn't even acknowledge me. What she didn't realize, was that at the time I was a stellar law student, a designer, and a business owner, that I was an actually intelligent and interesting person who, in about a year or two, would be exactly the kind of client the club would want."
t3_2f8s0s,ck8c7fa,"But what about premise 2? At the very least, we must acknowledge there is less reasonable debate about whether we need a government based military/police at all than whether we need a welfare system at all. In some cases -- if one could maintain that there isn't really any reasonable debate about the military/police question, while maintaining there is reasonable debate about welfare systems -- people would be able to accept my argument against welfare systems while rejecting the mirror argument against police/military."
t3_2dqcyj,cjs2c78,"The great depression wasn't good for businesses, but they didn't magically come up some way to cooperate and avoid it, nor was the government able to come up with a plan to prevent it. So I'm interested in more details as to who exactly is going to come in and save us here from something that you do acknowledge has the potential to collapse our economy, and how exactly they're going to do that. Personally, I think that if costs were driven down sufficiently by automation, a socialist system would make a lot of sense, and wouldn't be nearly as hard to achieve as you suspect."
t3_2byn8t,cjb2rns,"Even if you think anti-polygamy laws are as bad as anti-gay laws, two wrongs don't make a right. Anti-gay laws (especially the ones as harsh as in some African countries) are wrong, regardless of whether other countries don't acknowledge polygamist marriages as valid. In other words, if you imagine two worlds, one where western governments reject polygamy and African countries have anti-gay laws, and another where western governments reject polygamy and African countries do not have anti-gay laws, then the second one is clearly better."
t3_2ao0uk,cix3ejo,"If you want the best car possible, you build it out of metal. In the same way, if you want the best life possible, people have to acknowledge each others inalienable human rights. Living in a world where it's okay to kill and steal will lead to a miserable existence."

t3_2ah6lr,civ4716,"They simply spoke and acted on their beliefs and invited all people to join their cause. As others have pointed out, people like me that check in at TiA acknowledge the underlying issues that concern the tumblerinas that we find. I'll be the first to admit that this world has work to do."
t3_2a1jkp,ciqn0ib,"I'm just trying to figure out where you are coming from with this, because you seem to have contradictory statements. It sounds to me like you are just very uncomfortable with the fact that you have family / friends that are gay, and you don't like to acknowledge that fact. Because any of these statements could be made about heterosexual people as well, and yet you have narrowed your focus only to this narrow group of guests."

t3_28io13,cic1705,"The fact that you posted this makes that evident and it's ok, because white supremacy has caused a lot of blacks to hold a lot of disparaging beliefs about their own people. It's ok, but it is your duty to acknowledge that and to fight against it. OP, we black people are not inferior, some of us tip and some of us don't."

t3_286wmt,ci80xo1,"Both the modern African-American and American woman receive unequal social treatment, and current social movements - feminism included - are aiming to spread awareness of such inequalities. If they succeed in having the population acknowledge these inequalities, then people will also be more accepting of new connotations for these reclaimed slurs. "
t3_282lgu,ci6wglw,"Without a veto, Security council decisions would just be more ineffective and more symbolic, probably would eventually dissolve. So the UN acknowledges the fact that the UN is a voluntary organization, so to recognize that the 5 most powerful countries can effectively ignore any decision made, they just codify this into a veto, so at least the 5 most powerful countries will atleast sit in the same room. The real purpose of the UN isnt to pass ratifications, but its to get all the countries in the world to sit the fuck down in the same room and do diplomacy."
t3_26b1l1,chpr7to,"It is not unscientific to make a category, however fuzzy, of people who are aggregate related, and to then theorize on possible common traits between said group. To put it bluntly, for someone to acknowledge that the category ""blacks"" (meaning Sub-Saharan Africans or ""Negroids"") are more prone to sickle-cell anemia, and then saying race doesn't exist in the same breath is committing a form of doublethink. For that person to then dismiss any other claim of theoretical differences - such as mental ones like IQ and such - as ""impossible"" because race ""does not exist"" or because there is ""not enough distance between blacks and whites"" is even further doublethink."
t3_26b1l1,chpr7to,"They have no right to make such a claim because they do not have a frame of reference. The bottom line is if there's enough distance for what we already acknowledge to be different, there's no reason to deny mental differences too. The people who say race is a social construct, the smarter ones, don't REALLY believe most of it."
t3_23vw8b,ch13pcr,"Better maintained prisons focused on rehabilitation reduce reductivism on the part of the prisoners and helps us create a better society. I cannot empathize with that man, but I can acknowledge that endorsing such behavior weakens our ability to merit out justice and create a safer society. "
t3_22xij5,cgrdf4t,"But I don't feel ""guilty"" in any way shape or form, because like I think you're arguing, none of this is my fault or even remotely reflects any wrongdoing on my part. But I'd be a fool if I didn't acknowledge that these factors have helped give me an advantage in many aspects of my life. And when I go in to work and look around at my female coworker, my gay coworker, and my black coworker, its important that I acknowledge that many basic aspects of my life that I take for granted are not shared by them often (but not always) in ways that make things harder for them."

You're not supposed to feel guilty, you're just supposed to acknowledge and understand how it affects you and others around you. You're supposed to think about it whenever you're tempted to judge others through the lens of your own personal experiences rather than trying to understand how the challenges they face may be different from yours."
t3_226qii,cgjwndb,"It does seem like things are heading in that direction which makes me, sadly, believe I will become a very grumpy old person (if I get there). While I acknowledge the advances in technology that have allowed emails and mobiles to be part of our daily life and have generally improved things, I still miss the ability of being out of touch for a while sometimes. What you propose could potentially work for future generations if everyone would see it as normal because people are valuing privacy less and less, but for someone from a transitional generation like myself, that idea just makes me cringe and is inconceivable."
t3_21g901,cgct89q,"I'm guessing you didn't confront any of your friends about them cutting you off? The reason I say this, again purely from experience, is because if you confront people in high school about certain things, most of the time they will acknowledge that and learn. Teenagers tend to build these distorted realities based off their own assumptions which gets pretty bad."
t3_213mm2,cg9bbci,"The scientific method of observation and experimentation has proven to be the most effective means of understanding the universe. If you can show me one example of a ""spiritual"" explanation for a known phenomenon that is better than one using the scientific method, I will acknowledge it and change my mind. Can you say the same thing if you are unable to come up with one?"
t3_1xhgv0,cfbpidx,"This is why debate is essential. Even if you can't sway the person away from their closely held beliefs, you might at least be able to convince them that the other side isn't entirely wrong, and that they already acknowledge evidence based knowledge in other aspects of their lives. That step alone can get people to question the absolute validity of what they believe and open the door to making rational decisions rather than ones based on a cloudy interpretation of a very old book."
t3_1vougq,ceudmfn,"How does this resemble ""real life"" in any way? You semi-acknowledge that every generation considers the next one ""soft"". I know my father's generation did, and now I'm a parent of a 17 year old, and they seem to have things easier that we did."
t3_1vd61r,cer6nyz,"It isn't trans people angry because other people have self-esteem issues. It's because other people are taking away their only hope of temporary treatment for a very real medical problem that most of society won't even acknowledge (depending upon what country you live in..), and they are taking away their temporary medical treatment for a hobby, something that is extra just for their pleasure. edit: to add to the importance part, there is an extremely high suicide rate among trans individuals."
t3_1rzqrw,cdsmyt1,"If there is cognitive dissonance occurring then there cannot be complete apathy. So the real question you should ask yourself is why don't I change the way I act even after I acknowledge I should? After all, everything we do as humans is motivated by our need for survival and the fact that you cannot reconcile these actions with yourself is asymptomatic of your need to."
t3_1ohh43,ccs087t,"This level of functional differentiation requires different skillsets. In the same way that we acknowledge that the Air Force requires more technical knowhow, we see different standards for physical fitness in the Air Force as we see in the Marines, where brute physical skill is more often necessary. We also know that adding the diversity of ideas is one of the things that makes this country great, and our military is no exception."
t3_1nzucd,ccnphhf,You A.) acknowledge it isn't all of Islam and B.) would still take issue with their behavior if they weren't Islamic.
t3_1h3tmi,caqlx8h,"I would hope that if you meet somebody who believes in a god AND evolution that you wouldn't dismiss the latter. Aside from the fact that faith is inherently ingrained in almost every shred of knowledge or opinion that we have (which has been mentioned multiple times in this thread), faith also represents an acknowledgement that there are simply things that we don't understand. There are things out there in the universe that we have no way of explaining and no way of learning about...yet."
t3_1fh3pe,caa79wj,"Because you're part of the majority, you alone have the power to change this. Call your friends out on their racist jokes, report discrimination in the workplace, acknowledge that (even if you're not racist) that some people are and work to change that in whatever capacity you're able. No-one has any reason to feel guilty about injustice if they're working toward change."
t3_1dx9dj,c9v8b9b,"It's not very popular in our modern age; we prefer to talk about our 'rights' and all the things we are owed, and not the things we ought to do. However, I personally find that in many cases it is helpful to re-cast all the rights we acknowledge as duties, or at least to realize that duties have a place along with rights in our conception of how people should behave. Now, why I prefer the duty-based ethic to a rights-based one is a long conversation and I don't really want to fully go into it here, mostly because here we are dealing less with an ethical issue and more a civic one."
t3_1ajjfw,c8xzdi6,"Therefore you acknowledgment of privilege changes your actions. Perhaps not acknowledged your own privilege, but it is important to acknowledge that others may not have had as easy of a time getting to where they are as you did. If you are looking at others in a different light this will surely change your actions."
t3_1aah63,c8wdpmn,"Yeah, St. Augustine was a compatibilist, which means that he believed that free will and determinism are compatible. Granted, I'm no Christian, but compatibilism does start making sense if you do acknowledge something outside of causality, namely God and/or the soul. These supernatural factors allow your brain to have more ""freedom"" in decision-making than a ball rolling down a hill."
t3_18dj9h,c8l7u7y,"But we can't ignore our biology either and our place in the food chain and the circle of life. In some ways, we should act different from animals, obviously, but in other ways, it is ok to acknowledge and not fight against out animal desires. (Fucking, eating, boxing etc.)"
t3_2ylbub,cpan2i7,"Are you the consequentialist, ""these are the policies that lead to the best outcomes for everyone"" type? In that case you probably should acknowledge that, overall, one party is going to be better for the people than the other, whether or not either party is perfect. With that in mind, there's about a one in ten million chance of your vote changing the outcome (IIRC)."
t3_2x854p,coy1knj,"Products are the ""gods"" of our time. He knows it's a problem but acknowledges his own weakness towards it. It's deep when you understand where he comes from."

t3_2wh592,coqt473,You get to a point in which you don't want to hear people catcall you. You're tired of only being acknowledged because of the way you look. It can make you feel as though there's nothing more to you than your body.
t3_2wh592,coqt473,"In that video, a lot of these guys weren't just trying to give her a compliment. They were trying to get her acknowledgement. Then when she doesn't acknowledge them, they call after her and say rude things."
t3_2wh592,coqt473,"They were trying to get her acknowledgement. Then when she doesn't acknowledge them, they call after her and say rude things. They tell her that she should smile, one guy says ""somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful, you should say thank you more."""
t3_2wh592,coqt473,"Suddenly this guy is calling you a bitch or a cunt because you didn't stop to thank him or talk to him. He feels as though by him pointing out something about your physical appearance, you owe him gratitude and acknowledgement. If you don't give him that, then you are no longer beautiful, you're a bitch."
