t3_2rnr30,cnhlmdo,"Allowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor. I wont go into gun problems but rather define USA's basic laws and their impact on stopping situations like the one in Paris today. As a person living in a country with the right to bear arms, in my experience, when an incident like this occurs there aren't many armed civilians nearby to assist."
t3_2rnr30,cnhlmdo,Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring. Allowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.
t3_2rnr30,cnhotka,If you carry a gun with an 8 to 9 round magazine you better be a damn good shot because crazed gunmen usually come with automatic weapons or weapons with extended magazines and it may not be there only weapon. If half the citizens carried in public places MP5's with 30 round clips you may be able stop a few random encounters over the years but then again you'd have citizens turning into militants. 
t3_2rnfn0,cnhjtqq,"Does it not do both of those in a better way ? It's assumed that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response."
t3_2rnfn0,cnhjtqq,"You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like ""she shouldn't have been there"" we are exactly saying ""This would never happen to me because I would never do that"" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world."

t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"The same goes for philosophy. Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's Tractatus , but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference. So for the reason alone that it is virtually impossible to reach high levels of philosophy without first understanding the foundations, studying philosophy is a worthwhile endeavor because it gives the student access to knowledge that would have been highly arcane to them had they not studied the subject."
t3_2rmy6e,cnhmkxc,"Many people who have never studied the subject believe to learn philosophy is to sit around shooting the shit about hypothetical questions and hackneyed moral quandaries. In actuality, my philosophical education (I minored in it but took as many classes in it as a major) involved tons of rigorous reading and papers, and included topics like AI theory, nature studies, and tort law. The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible."

t3_2rmwcd,cnhbzmc,"The incidents you describe are vigilantism of the worst kind. Free speech will always include speech which offends, but causing offense isn't a violation of the social contract. Vigilante violence against people who offend you is."
t3_2rmwcd,cnhbzmc,"Consider that the alternative to free speech is government violently suppressing speech. In that case, not only do the bullies still get to use violence to suppress the speech which offends them, but now they don't face the consequences of using violence in violation of the social contract. That seems like a lose-lose to me."
t3_2rkzen,cnhbiku,"Environment combines with genes to make a person who they are, and we're ultimately better off as a species if we have the largest gene pool possible. As you put it, the entire goal of eugenics is to make the human race more likely to advance and survive, but the irony of eugenics is that one of the best ways we can guarantee our survival is to maximize the size of our gene pool. Eugenics makes the assumption that we know which genes are good and which genes are bad, and by maximizing the ""good"" genes and minimizing the ""bad"" genes, our society will be vastly better off."
t3_2rkzen,cnhn00f,"Period. You can limit the less intelligent, but you can't force the more intelligent to have them. That's the real flaw in the plan."
t3_2rkjr3,cnhhz9u,"I do not think knowledgeable people are wasting their time by contributing their knowledge to a form that can be quickly scanned to understand the most upvoted (and hopefully best) arguments for and against a point.

t3_2rekjo,cnf5hhy,"Option 2 is very restricting. Option 4: you don't care for animals' suffering but you enjoy their taste, so you continue to support the meat industry. This doesn't necessarily mean that I am paying money so that some animal on the other side of the world gets abused for my pleasure that I don't even witness."
t3_2rcrkd,cnfccqz,"That is what I meant by derailing. Cows don't care about messed up environment, but raped person will be damaged even more by STI. STIs of single person don't cause problems to every person on the planet."

t3_2rcrkd,cng1g5i,And maybe we will manage to figure something to save environment or slow destruction down even more in that time that we saved. This is interesting but different discussion. I don't think slowing down destruction of environment is useless.
t3_2rcrkd,cng1g5i,It is more like pumping water from lower decks if you are such fan of analogies. Won't save us but lets to run longer. And maybe we will manage to figure something to save environment or slow destruction down even more in that time that we saved.
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"In fact, those hoping for an Internet with real IDs, I hope people come after them with pitchforks! 4chan has certainly desensitized me through the years, but has shown me another side of the human psyche. This side is normally censored and hidden away."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"It was a place of complete and total anonymity and we were happy with it that way. If we wanted to put ourselves out there, we could but we weren't encouraged to do so as a societal norm.

t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"4chan, there's no upvotes. There's a lot of noise on 4chan, but you can navigate past it and find some excellent content. See a thread you want to comment on, go in and drop a bomb."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"Leave if you want, if you don't, keep hitting F5. You can ignore someone, sure, but their comment will be right up top where yours is chronologically on any of the chans. If someone hurts your feelings, either pick it apart or ignore it."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"Reddit has a bunch of dickheads trying to start a thread from the same link (all racing for karma) and then the thread will have to gain enough momentum to appear on the front page so unless I'm in the /new/ wasteland, I am behind the curve. 4chan may have it posted multiple times within seconds/minutes as well, but the one with the most enticing headline and immediate comments will always appear on the front page (or at least in the catalog) and the successful thread is the one used to near capacity, then redirected to the next big thread all the while without karma whores pushing eachother for control...the would-be karma whores are simply wasting their time trying to use a thread that's not as popular about a same topic. So while I've already discussed the news of the day on 4chan, I can discuss the news of yesterday on reddit."
t3_2rawgb,cnerfm7,"women, Jews, blacks, etc are protected classes as it is politically incorrect to attack them, the winners of the war write the history, the educators revise the history etc etc. If someone is an asshole and ""triggers"" someone into doing something, it's sad, but the ""triggered"" still makes their own choice. We are not robots."
t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"Whether you believe this burden is unfair to the point where bad consequences are a form of comeuppance is up to you, but that would require you to believe that all risky behavior requires the implicit permission of all your social connections- which isn't a standard I would want to limit myself to. You're completely correct in the belief that medical people going to Africa to treat ebola are putting themselves at risk of catching ebola, but all-in-all the chance of catching ebola in a controlled environment is very low, so low in fact that the news continues to report on each case that occurs. While others have compared to firemen, the analogy doesn't do the ebola workers justice, as 93 firemen died on duty in 2013 while only a handful of ebola volunteers have died."
t3_2r9169,cndtdts,"What most people should expect is to return home safety to their families. Obviously the risk of catching ebola is higher, but it is such a low percentage chance that it could almost be ignored. Volunteers do place a burden on their family."

t3_2r7f0g,cnd4xb4,"Their Prime Directive is to leave these alien worlds to develop on their own as they would until they become space fairing as well and can more evenly have diplomatic relations. In Avatar, perhaps its a more cynical and arguably more realistic situation where the corporations come in with their might and try to reap the bounty from the world regardless of the native's desires... but does that justify them? If an alien race were to descend onto Earth, our home planet, and start mining out cities headless of our protests, would it make it any more right?"
t3_2r6fw9,cncxwgs,"If stored properly, food is fully edible past that time. For instance, eggs are generally fully edible weeks after the sell by date, but may be less optimal for baking. 'Decomposition' begins as soon as the meat or vegetables are no longer living."
t3_2r6a86,cncxj5i,"It would be who can first get it and when because they suddenly become OP. If items where nerfed excessively, I would see were you where coming from, but what would be the purpose of having them. If there is a random aspect, it isn't competitive."

t3_2r4u3k,cncnikt,"I think that it ultimately comes down to the fact that the company has more reason for asking you to dress a certain way than simply representing the company. That is certainly one reason why they would create a dress code, but there are others as well. Establishing an environment of professionalism and productivity is crucial for a business to be successful, and the way that individuals dress impacts the general atmosphere of an environment pretty heavily ."
t3_2r4b8f,cnchpr4,"15/16? It doesnt make the 30 year old automatically smarter/more intelligent/more wise than the 17 year old, but the odds of that being true are absolutely in the older person's favor. Try talking to someone that's 12 or 13."
t3_2r3fa4,cnc6h09,"It is also possible to believe in an afterlife where you are judged solely by how good of a person you are and NOT your beliefs. I can go more in depth if you want, but I believe that your religion or lack thereof doesn't make a bit of difference in how you're judged at the end of your life. I also don't believe in either eternal punishment or eternal reward."
t3_2r0eyf,cnb8f1r,"Personally, as URL , I don't think such a separation is necessary. Sure, our decisions are the result of physical processes, but why does that make them less meaningful? When I make a choice, I perceive the thought process that leads to it, and I recognise it as my own."
t3_2r0eyf,cnb8f1r,"Why should it matter whether that agency exists outside the rules of the universe? In short: We may not have ""free will"" but we certainly have ""will"", and that's all that really matters. "
t3_2r07cv,cnbl2z0,"So the only case for immorality is against those who would ostracize the people who act differently than we as society expect based on their differences.

t3_2r07cv,cnbep9a,"So regardless of biological gender, crossdressing itself is not addressed in the bible. You could say it's an ACT of homosexuality, but hey, if you're transgender, it's an act of daily life. It all depends on the motivation behind why they wear it."
t3_2r07cv,cnbep9a,"It just wants you to use your sperm to procreate because if you don't, the Jews will literally die out. PS - I know I've referred to homosexuality a lot in this post, but that's purely because transgender folks get shit on by Christians because they're perceived to be some sort of mutated homosexual and every argument against the existence of homosexuals in the bible is invalid. "
t3_2r07cv,cnbkdhs,"Interesting. I took ejaculation outside the vagina and other stuff like Jewish men not talking to Samaritan women or even prohibition of homosexual relations as a means to preserving semen for the continuation of their own people, not because of modern conservative fears but because of actual child survival rates in that time period. I see religion, especially back then, as a method of controlling the masses, so that's sorta how I came to that conclusion."
t3_2qy21w,cnaxt0m,"Men who want to have children someday and get one before they're ready? Well, it's not 100% fair, but it's fairer than allowing him to force an unwanted abortion on a woman who loves her child to be and wants to keep it, or allowing him to disavow his financial responsibility by saying he doesn't want this particular child. If you want children, sometimes you're not going to get precisely the child you want."
t3_2qy21w,cnb1crf,"Maybe she'll never get pregnant again. Maybe this child will be healthy, but if she waits til later, that other baby will have a birth defect. Life is not under our control, and this is especially true in the fraught and unpredictable realm of reproduction."

You may as well be playing with cheat codes."

I can see where you're coming from, but ultimately we have to draw the line somewhere (barring some kind of system whereby medical practitioners individually assess people and legally declare their ability to grant consent).

t3_2hcsbm,ckrgs3i,"If anything, I would argue it takes more skill and difficulty to be able to master multiple functions at once compared to footballers who each have 1 specific function to master. For example, linemen ONLY have to be big and learn how to block and ""wrestle"" but a shooting guard has to know how to dribble, shoot, set up screens, etc , etc. In order to be on an NBA team, arguably, you have to be elite at multiple skills rather than a few specific ones."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrgs3i,"However, I will add that as a sport, the stopping time is incredibly boring. To your third point, there are a variety of plays that can be executed in football but I think the starting and stopping nature of the game detracts greatly from this. In football, you have time to plan and consult your coach before pretty much every other play."
t3_2hcsbm,ckrhha6,You claim track or gymnastics as inferior because there's only one skill that's perfected instead of many skills being balanced yet somehow also claim credit for the specialization of football players. Apparently being a well rounded sport makes you the best but well rounded athletes doesn't. I'm not even arguing that there is another sport that can supplant football as the best.

t3_2eahyl,cjxtave,"A fade out that is involving the choruses usually tends to be a slightly different chorus than the others, whether it be more layers of music or more layers of vocals to make it stand out as the climax of the song. I don't really listen to much pop music nowadays, but if your opinion can be changed on it's use in albums theatrically, I'm convinced you'll be able to understand it's use structurally. In URL , the outro/fadeout very obviously feels like the apex of the song."
t3_2eahyl,cjxtave,"If you take URL as another example, the ending of this song during it's climax is an abrupt one. It takes the same concept of ending at the top, but not with a fadeout. However, your definition would make it seem like you would consider this to be lazy and inferior too because they didn't take the time to create a proper ending."

Just two things: This reasoning makes sense given the current political climate but it doesn't cover loopholes where people who pay a large proportion of taxes vote for government programs which return money and benefits to them indirectly (not reducing their tax burden). You aren't accounting for how self-interest will manifest with this new voting system.

At first glance your view seemed strange because it seems like you're saying that automation will not be a problem in the future because automation will be a problem in the future, but that we'll ""solve"" it, thus preventing it from being a problem.

From what I understand, you believe that a recession is coming due to automation but that when it occurs either: a)Companies will realise the cause and either not automate because of it or if they already have they will de-automate. b)Governments will realise the cause and take action to get us out of recession."
t3_2dqcyj,cjsajv6,b)2 possible government solutions are mandatory human employment of a % of their workforce or moving to Universal Income. Both will be heavily resisted by many but also as they would be taxed more they would be less profitable and therefore less competitive in the global market. Other countries that have yet to do this would have far more efficient automated companies with cheaper products which would out compete domestic companies and further damage profits.

Me not eating meat might make a minuscule difference, but when it comes to my personal meat consumption, even reducing the amount of meat I eat by 50% is a great difference. total vegetarians reduce their meat consumption by 100% so their personal contribution is huge, even if they still eat dairy and eggs."

The first is that American Labor is now competing with foreign labor even in service industries, outsourcing depresses the job market in terms of total employment and wages but it has also pulled an estimated 2 Billion people on Earth out of poverty into a global middle class, keeps the cost of living much lower than it would be otherwise, and even makes shareholders wealthier. The problem is that COMPANIES now have extra choices, but WORKERS don't."

t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"They were accused of trying to convert people away from Christianity, and due to Emperor Constantine making it the official religion of the Roman empire, this was heavily frowned upon and was preceded by Germany, England and other nations when concerning the expulsion of the Jews. Most went to modern day Portugal but many still went to Israel. The favoring of Jews among the Muslims fell (or at least continued to rapidly decline) along with the Umayyad caliphate (a Muslim and spiritual community founded after Muhammed's death)."

t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"stating things how religious beliefs would not cause a problem . But in 1917 there was a British conquest on Palestine which had many Zionist (Jews) volunteering to help the Brits in their mission but of course this didn't come without opposition, riots broke out in 1920 against the British rule and Jewish migration (though at this time the Jewish population was only around 10 percent, give or take). There were 2 more Aliyahs (migration of Jews into Palestine) between 1919-1929 and then finally in the 1930's the holocaust and Nazism caused a flux of a quarter million Jews to move into Palestine to escape the German ran genocide which caused another revolt in Palestine between 1936 to about 1939 and by the end of WWII, the Jewish population now accounted for about 1/3rd of the population in Palestine."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Israel agreed, Palestine did not. This may seem stubborn but imagine Britain came into your country and demanded a state of province would be given to a race of people who govern on a completely different theocratic idea which does not hold much with yours.

Of course they don't get the same luxury of being given land as Israel was."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"Now it has degraded even further, the hubris of it all as both sides are so strongly tied to the idea that they are spiritually given the right, as in God is on their side, to win this fight against eachother. It isn't even about the invasion (as some might call it, though I just see it as a sad displacement) from the Jews anymore, but a fanatical idea that God wants them to win and take their land (back), and we know these are pretty theocratic nations so this belief cannot be conquered by simple reason. What a shame."
t3_2c1mga,cjc4wg5,"What a shame. TL;DR Well I hate making TL;DR's, I feel people won't understand the whole idea, but this might need it as very few will read the whole thing. Jew's were constantly being displaced by varying factors, Britain and the U.N. helped them by giving them someone elses land, fights happened, so did ceasefires and peace treaties, more fights happened, now these theocratic places believe they are spiritually entitled to it and will not stop unless they win."

Your argument sounds so similar to others that we hear from people who know nothing about trans* people but still have tons of opinions about how wrong we are.

Maybe you have better friends than I've had, but in my experience even your best friend will not care as much about your problems as a decent lover. That being said, I'm not sure if you're trying to justify never pursuing a relationship or if you're just trying to say that your methods are morally fine."

The thing about all this is that when you first meet with someone you likely have common interests, and over time some of those things you do care about may suddenly lose priority in your mind because as you've spent time with this other person (or simply matured in some cases) you suddenly don't want to do the same things you used to want to do anymore."

t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"Only in recent years has depression garnered any sort of public acceptance, and it remains a struggle in our society to be perceived as depressed due to the lack of understanding and compassion needed to combat this disease. Traditionally, (and I'm using the USA as an example as I live here, but the same can be said of other Western countries) our society has always had a ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"" mentality. So having a condition like depression, a condition you can't physically see, is met with disdain."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"And you're stuck watching everyone around you function and wondering why it's so inherently difficult for you. You can't mention your condition to people who don't have it, and of the people who don't have it, you can never be sure who will understand (who understand that it's a reality, that there's something physically wrong with your brain, but that that doesn't make you crazy). You learn the hard way that you can't take chances, because you know that people who don't not understand that it's a disease will not treat you like you have a disease."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"But even if these people don't understand or you feel like you can't talk to them about it, they're your friends. When depressed people hang around the people they like, but can't necessarily trust with their very fragile inner selves, they act. They smile, even if the smile is pasted on and hurts."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"So depressed people can still smile because: 1\. Depression doesn't mean you're sad ALL the time, but it does make everything a struggle 2\. They want to seem like they're okay even when they're not."
t3_27ea43,ci005dx,"I think the problem that leads to people like you not understanding about this condition is that you can't physically see it. It may be physical, but you can't see the affected areas of their brain on a daily basis. You can only see their behavior."

All of this combines to make Beauty and the Beast the movie that doesn't do anything best but one without any true flaw or any objective flaw, by which I mean I think some of the classics get discounted a bit due to age and familiarity. Many of the people now saying Beauty and the Beast saw this as kids in the theater so ""the best"" Disney movie is about a three or four way competition where The Lion King doesn't have as good a hero, The Little Mermaid doesn't have as good a love interest, and Aladdin doesn't have as good a story."

Certain instruments have very subtle properties that make their exact musical applications quite variable, subtle and actually quite specific, for instance, of course learning the Bassoon may seem limited, but the instrument itself fits into a larger orchestra setting very well and can be extremely expressive by itself, not knowing the subtle dynamics of any of these instruments means that it's would be extremely difficult for electronic programs to capture them. Even if a computer can create it, the actual nature of the instrument means that the end result would differ because there are physical limitations and properties that create a wonderful variance."

t3_24b8ko,ch66f4q,"Regarding the ""3 challenges"" and their proposed analogous responses: 1) No, there is no scientific basis to say we should value health. That doesn't stop science from working on improving health, any more than it would stop science from working on improving well being, but morality is exactly that value judgement of what we ""should"" value. The analogy isn't in any way analogous, because it operates at the wrong level."
t3_24b8ko,ch66f4q,"The analogy isn't in any way analogous, because it operates at the wrong level.

t3_24b8ko,ch66f4q,"If your only moral principle is maximizing well-being, then people are put into the position of having to determine all of the outcomes of their actions ab initio, which is strictly impossible. Killing Hitler as a child would have vastly improved world-wide well being (I'm not saying that WWII wouldn't have arisen without him, but the presence of a charismatic leader at that time made the rise of fascism much faster and more effective than it would have been without him). But by what possible means could any person have possibly determined that this would be the case, and in any event why would their opinion about this be an overriding consideration, and what if people disagree?"
t3_24b8ko,ch66f4q,"Saying that ""well being"" is the moral value that science should pursue seems to be a complete non sequitor from a scientific point of view.

They enter an Afghanistan-like state, fighting an insurgency that not only encompasses a huge nation, but which allows patrols to be picked off. Eventually, the production methods still cause an issue for the military; the destruction of infrastructure makes it harder for everyone to function, famine becomes an issue, and the military faces issues getting supplies to itself and to the civilians supporting it."

Somebody who hears about such an event doesn't usually know the whole story, but there are a lot of reasons that it could've happened, there's usually some history of badness between the shooter and victim, there are many motivations that the killer could have had, and (opinions vary) some circumstances where it even seems a little justified. A bombing is much less discriminate."

Obviously this is not always true, as in your case, but I would say that a good deal of my faith is owed to my parents. For all their faults, they are two of the most upright, kind, and righteous people I know, and their ardent faith and the community with which they surrounded me led me to understand that religion is a powerful and wonderful force."
t3_21006g,cg8jacm,"But that's not how I see it. Sure, there are lots of churches and sects that abuse their influence, but to me, it's more of a passing-on than an instilling-in.

My body is biologically female, in the sense of it's function (with the exception of my reproductive system, but there are a lot more gender differences than that). So as I mentioned earlier, because we're born with a structure in our brain that tells us what we identify as (and brain structure is immutable), I identify as a woman."

He's going to die in a few seconds."

This is an extreme example, but there are many situations every day where a lie has literally no downside and can make someone feel better.

I'd also worry about the presumption of consent when it comes to violence."
t3_20ofb2,cg5jm4p,"I didn't. I obviously didn't enjoy being beaten up but for some reason I never hit back. It was a really miserable time for me and sometimes I wished that I had fought back, but in those moments I failed to get angry, I just felt sad and humiliated."

Maybe it makes me better than them, or weaker."
t3_20ofb2,cg5jm4p,"I'm sure the answer will be that they are abused at home, or are taught that physical power is the ultimate power. Again, to fight violence with violence may seem fair and may put a bully in his or her place (at least temporarily), but by doing so we only perpetuate the supposed power of violence. The victim that fights back gets a taste of that power, and the bully might simply move on to a new victim."
t3_20ofb2,cg5kvls,"I suggest a third option: do neither. You won't be seen as a rat and you won't be seen as a hero but bullies look for affirmation - whether it's tears, fists or snitching - the easiest way to neutralize a bully is to offer no affirmation or response. Ignore them."

t3_20mxh2,cg5k6xt,"I mean if you have 10million it'll always be cheaper to just higher someone for 30,000 a year instead of risk a million dollar fine. The problem with making fines proportional is that you are no longer punishing the crime, but instead punishing rich people for being richer. The idea of a fine is that you are essentially paying what you cost society by committing the crime."

I think we can both agree this doesn't make sense, but that's because this punishes the person instead of the crime. The punishment for assault should be the same regardless of who assaults whom."

Yes, the Internet may allow for the English language to change subtly over the next half-century but I highly doubt we will lose such drastic distinctions as you suggest in our language. I believe your argument is similar to Koine Greek, which was the language taken up by the uneducated."
t3_1zrq6d,cfwexd1,"Also, with open access journals such as PLoS One, the decision to accept or reject a manuscript is made before the journal requests its publication fee. So if someone can't afford the publication fee, but the paper was accepted, PLoS will waive the fee. So, if you've got a good study, it will still get published under the OA model regardless of whether you can pay."

They might still publish in a lesser journal, but they could've done that anyway under the current system. Additionally, I'm not sure big corporations really care all that much if their studies get published."
t3_1zrq6d,cfwju7x,"That's your bread and butter. Perhaps it's a difference in our disciplines, but I think if you were to ask people in my field, they'd tell you that they don't tend to put a lot of faith in meta-analyses.

You'll have to forgive me if I don't fully get how drug approval works, but it was my understanding that drug companies only needed to provide the outcomes of their testing and a report of their conclusions to the FDA. I didn't think they needed to have their results published in a peer-reviewed journal."

We say that people in the 'overweight' category are fat, but more precise studies have found the longest average lifespan is in people who are in the overweight category, with only slightly overweight people having the best outcomes (note there's an alternative explanation here in that it's possible weightlifters are throwing off the data because of a high likelihood of being in the slightly overweight category). (my note taking habits are atrocious, will find the studies in a day or two if anybody finds the argument compelling but wants to see the evidence themselves before changing their minds) Now, as to what HAES is: HAES seeks to: 1) Improve fitness."

t3_1yoc2s,cfmhw1d,"Then you can draw a circle around the traits and have some meaning. So the TL;DR is that if you play the law of averages, you can get some meaningful information about these people, but not all of it applies to the individual, and not all to the same degree. The girl who doesn't line up directly at the center of the cluster of girl traits does not suddenly become a boy, nor does the boy who is at the edge of the boy-circle stop being a boy."
t3_1yoc2s,cfmhw1d,"The thing would be true of race or sexuality And the harm of stereotypes is that in the realm of social interactions and economic interactions, using the stereotype to make judgements about the desireablilty of someone in group X can cause harm. They prevent a person from rising on their own merits, they make people uncomfortable because it's assumed a woman likes X but not Y, when for that individual woman that's not true.

I've never been a huge fan of cricket, takes a little too long for my tastes, but ARF has tons of scoring and that has never deterred me from watching it. I feel if you are just looking at how much scoring is being done then you're looking at the game wrong or trying to appreciate it for the wrong reasons, so I'll try to break it down."
t3_1tt75b,cebecvh,"It shouldn't, it just means you need to approach the game differently. Every time you come down the court your goal is to score a basket, just like in every other sport, but it just so happens the scoring percentage is much higher. I think part of the problem, especially in the NBA, is that the players are so skilled offensively they make it look easy when it really isn't."
t3_1tt75b,cebecvh,"I think part of the problem, especially in the NBA, is that the players are so skilled offensively they make it look easy when it really isn't. Ideally you want to get an open shot or an open lane to the rim for an easy bucket, but you need to be very quick and take opportunities that last for less than seconds and need to make the judgement on the spot. What makes the sport enjoyable to watch is seeing them make those quick decisions and hit a good shot, or seeing them working with what they got and making a contested play anyway."

Basketball allows some amount of physical contact, but if you let guys that big bump each other harder on a hardwood court you'd have way too many injuries, it just can't be done. I'm not against physical contact in sports though, all my favourite sports have it."

t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"If this were still the case, I could easily answer your question - empathy is the means to which, given such a simplistic realisation of the world, we are forced to co-operate to achieve the highest we can be individually. Prisoner's Dilemmas are, after all, a decent model of the world - it is almost always more self-beneficial to be selfish rather than co-operative, but we know people DO co-operate; this helps explain why, as both will benefit more from being generous in the long term. Of course, it's worth noting that this is not always an obvious choice - indeed, most systems rely on people being uncooperative so that they can influence their score detrimentally."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"Messers Press &amp; Dyson published a paper last year entitled ""Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent"". In it, they describe a method where you can not only ensure you get a better score than your opponent, but that in fact the best possible strategy in a one-one situation was extortion - you can force the opponents score to be a multiple of your own. This was a huge shock as you can imagine - the view that all things must co-operate was suddenly shown to make no sense - why would anyone play anything other than an extortion strategy when you ensure either you vastly dominate them or, if both parties are attempting to extort, they are forced to co-operate, yet still dominate all other opponents?"
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"That will diminish both your score and theirs. Sure, you'll win but your score will not be high. 2 players cooperating can expect their average score per iteration to be 3 - this is the reward after all, so we have a very easy benchmark."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"This was published in the same paper. In it, you don't aim to extort but instead fix the oppositions score. Let's say we want to force it to be 2, for example."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"Let's say we want to force it to be 2, for example. Well, it's far harder to detect such a strategy but again, this runs into huge issues with an uncooperative player. In fact, you will force their score to be 2 even when they are always defecting, meaning you will get a pitiful score."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"This is obviously a poor choice. However, it's far harder to see - it is a strategy that appears to attempt to maximise yours but never does, fixing it instead. This is where my thesis comes in, though it's already been shown such ZD strategies are unstable, so stop working after a while in any evolving population."
t3_1pdul1,cd1d692,"It's no surprise that you need a mind and memory to spot and avoid these ZD strategies and then see that humans are the most intelligent things alive, winning the evolutionary arms race by dominating other species.

With the international superpower added to this picture, both nations know that they are completely incapable of maintaining any sort of military force capable of even beginning to stand up to the superpower, preventing not only the arms race and direct violence, but also even the destructive river project that would destabilize the region.

t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"Freedom isn't free, and it's no less free simply because we've already beaten down the biggest threats out there to it. I think you are looking for an idealistic response to this, but sadly the political world isn't about looking pretty and being idealistic. There's a commonly held belief in global politics stemming from Karl Von Clausewitz that ""War is the continuation of Politik by other means"", and by extension, that war (and violence of varying scale) occurs where it is the most viable option for entities to advance their goals."
t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"The only real way to make war not a viable option (and thus guarantee peace) is to maintain a omnipresent threat of imminent doom should violence be put on the table. Right now, yes, there have been episodes of violence worldwide since the second world war, but the sum total of armed conflict from the end of Second World War to now represents a small fraction of what either world war was. In essence, despite the existence of armed conflict still in the world, we are in a period of relative peace that has been enforced first by US and Soviet power, and since the fall of the soviet union, by US hegemony."

t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"Peacekeepers work out of the threat of overwhelming violence potential - people tend not to fuck with peacekeepers, because the response is quick, violent, and incredibly asymmetrical.

t3_1onlj1,cctr8zg,"The numbers simply don't support that the US keeps up militarism for economic purposes. So, in summary, being a soldier isn't a pretty job, but it's certainly a necessary one. Peace exists because there's someone walking around with a very very big, unpleasant stick that wants peace to continue."
t3_1onlj1,cctt1me,"Peace is not valued by those who believe that which can be gained by war is worth the violence required to achieve it. The second seems reprehensible, but consider also that the option for violence deters destructive nonviolent actions as well. Consider a case of two nations on a river, one upstream, one downstream."
t3_1onlj1,cctt1me,"The upstream nation could divert the river to a dry plateau, doubling its farming capacity while starving the downstream nation. It's nothing violent, simply selfish, but it still screws over the downstream nation, and there's no concrete action the downstream nation can take as a peaceful nonthreatening alternative to protect itself and its own interests. However, if there exists a risk of war, the upstream nation might be less willing to screw over their downstream neighbor, if doing so might have negative consequences."
t3_1onlj1,cctt1me,"However, if there exists a risk of war, the upstream nation might be less willing to screw over their downstream neighbor, if doing so might have negative consequences. This is a very extreme example, but the reality is that all nations exist in a competitive global market, and these sorts of actively conflicting interests are a constant reality. By all means, where possible, you seek a collaborative solution, but in some cases there are boundaries that a nation cannot allow to be crossed, and it's up to that nation to engender respect for those boundaries above and beyond other nations' economic self-interest."

t3_1onlj1,cctt1me,"To advance our river nations example, this river diversion issue could lead to an arms race simply over the threat of this river project, which would then lead into a massive scale war as soon as one side got too confident in its strength and made the determination that it could wipe out the other nation and either abuse it economically in the future or take it over entirely. With the international superpower added to this picture, both nations know that they are completely incapable of maintaining any sort of military force capable of even beginning to stand up to the superpower, preventing not only the arms race and direct violence, but also even the destructive river project that would destabilize the region. Essentially, the decision to go to war is a cost/benefit analysis."
t3_1onlj1,cctt1me,"The presence of the superpower in the picture guarantees that the benefit is zero or negative, and the cost is extraordinarily high in every single case. It would be nice to be able to believe that everyone is good enough to refrain from aggressive activity out of the goodness of their hearts, but that's not realistic in a competitive world. "

That is, they may be good at the nuts-and-bolts of day-to-day engineering matters, but some of them can't write a coherent paragraph to save their life or communicate clearly with other people.

Well, for one, intellectual curiosity drove a lot of polymaths to study a variety of subjects, but for another it makes you a more knowledgeable person and the interconnectedness of different discipline reenforces your skills.

I don't have to turn my head to look at the laptop or TV, the tablet stays put over the sink :) And it's easy to clean if I get grease or food bits on it when I'm cooking (I prop it up on the stove), I just wipe it off, but with a netbook I'd have to clean every little opening, gross!

I do like the idea of breaking up the 'too big to fail' companies but let me also offer another potential solution. All the companies that qualify as to big to fail should also have a special assessment that funds a bailout pool that kicks into action if one of the companies begins to destabilize or fail.
t3_1htdmd,caxz72q,All the companies that qualify as to big to fail should also have a special assessment that funds a bailout pool that kicks into action if one of the companies begins to destabilize or fail.

Also Companies that are too big to fail should have to go through another layer of regulatory oversight.

t3_1eqpep,ca2vk92,"A lot of people are making some claims about polyamory and the cultural roots of the (fairly modern) preference toward monogamous relationships that I feel are either unfounded or irrelevant. I don't know if there are enough rigorous studies to really draw broad conclusions about whether polyamory in modern times is a significantly more or less healthy lifestyle than monogamous relationships on average, but the intuition that monogamy is inherently more stable and less problematic is pretty much necessarily going to be heavily culturally biased by the status quo. I don't think that's a point that anyone really has the background to argue here without it being largely bullshit, myself included, and besides, I happen to agree that there's nothing inherently wrong with polyamory and that it should be more culturally accepted, and don't particularly feel like playing devil's advocate about that."

t3_1cyk99,c9laccj,"Python is a scripting language, it was designed solely for programmers to churn out as much code as possible without having to worry about things such as compilers, data types, or optimization. It is important for new programmers to not only learn the process of writing code, but it is also important to have a basic understanding of how a computer interprets the code you write. I find that Java is the best balance of learning how to program as well as learning how programs work."
t3_1cyk99,c9laccj,"Going back to your car analogy, think of Java as learning to drive in a stick shift. You'll have to learn how to shift properly along with actually driving, but in the process, you learn more about how an engine and transmission works, and you'll be able to drive more efficiently, learning automatic will be easy for you, and if your car breaks down, you might have a better idea of what's wrong because you know more about how it works under the hood.

Very little money has been but into researching these technologies (especially when compared side by side to the billions in subsidies that go towards nuclear power and fossil fuel production), but there is already a lot of research being done in increasing the efficiency of solar and wind, as well as the development of technologies that allow the storage of these energies. And despite popular belief, they are pretty damn reliable at producing energy."
t3_1cfa2w,c9g116t,"People working in GIS have mapped out all of everywhere, and it is easy to find which areas have the highest generating capacity for wind and solar and plan accordingly.

A few people on my floor decided to rush."

I admit it is pretty hard to find good numbers to describe exactly how much CO2's put out by people driving, and studies show up with different numbers, but scientists appear to agree that it's a lot, and probably not a good idea to keep doing it.

Either you are indeed innocent and the consequences should be small enough because you are innocent until proven otherwise (in reality things don't always happen like this but it's more of a systematic problem with the system than anything else), or you indeed committed a rape without realizing it (many people tend to freeze rather than scream when they get scared) and here again the consequences aren't supposed to be as dire because your intentions are supposed to play a very important role."

t3_2sjdom,cnq12g5,"Some forums are heavily moderated, others aren't, and users can pick the ones they want. For the forums that are moderated heavily, you may not appreciate that some of your comments got deleted, but all the other users do appreciate that, and that's why they use that forum over another less moderated one.

t3_2sjck6,cnq7kou,"Now what really differentiates consoles are exclusive titles and in this category, Nintendo (as a developer) is pretty much flawless. Their games might take a while to get out, but they are usually really good. The reason for this is partly because they created their own console so they know how to work with it."
t3_2sf2we,cnp29jv,"While physical attractivity is also part of it it's hopefully not everything. And if you meet someone who you think is nice, but end up finding incredible sexually attractive because of their other attributes that being a large factor is a non-issue since it follows from the person having other desirable attributes! "
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8yko,"I have used this argument, in a different form to talk about the annihilation of local culture in the city in which I was born. It's a stubborn place, but it's lost much of its unique character, and is fighting to hold onto what is left. That said, however, change is the only thing that's certain, and what you think of as quintessentially ""Seattle"" or ""London"" or ""Berlin"" may not jive with what someone who lived there in the seventies thinks of as quintessential."
t3_2s5c4b,cnnrb9q,"This would, of course, destroy society, so we can't do that. So then the question is who are we specifically trying to protect from offense, and why do they get that protection but other people don't? If we're going to ban speech that's offensive to Muslims, for instance, is it because we think they're too weak to handle it?"
t3_2s5c4b,cnnrb9q,"Is it because we think that Allah is the one true God and Muhammad is his prophet? That implies that we too are Muslims; I'm sure Muslims would find that reasoning sufficient to at least justify not saying such things themselves, but there are a lot of people who aren't Muslims, and unless you're planning to ban blasphemy against any and all religions (which is definitely not free speech) or openly favor one or more of them over the others for your own reasons (which certainly isn't equal treatment under the law), this just takes us back to the question of why we're banning speech that's offensive to Muslims. I can understand advising people to use their freedom of speech responsibly, but the freedom to be an obnoxious douche is required for speech to be free."

t3_2s38n0,cnm8elm,"Either you believe that: (a) everybody of every faith should follow Islamic law or (b) Charlie Hebdo stood alone defending freedom of speech and freedom of faith. Frankly, I don't think the comics were particularly insightful or funny, but the biggest tragedy in the support for Charlie Hebdo is that it didn't come sooner. "
t3_2s11ys,cnl9jcv,"If you live forever, there will come a time when everything that's ever happened in the universe will be a distant memory, and the vast majority of your experience will be you among nothingness. Are you sure what you want to argue for is living forever, as opposed to, say, a few thousand years, or maybe some other large but finite amount of time? Forever means you outlive your species, your planet, your galaxy, and the existence of everything that's ever been and ever will be, all the way up to and beyond the heat death of the universe."
t3_2s0mca,cnl4rwb,"In the movies, Hermoine was given many of the characteristics that Ron had in the books. as you said you are 100% correct in saying that, but think about the alternative. If Ron kept his role in the trio (heart) and gave Harry most of the action, Hermione would be less of a character."
t3_2s04yv,cnldfng,"That's in no means racist. Non-racism should not cause us to ignore how someone looks, or how people of their culture behave, but simply to give them respect. Respect that they are different."
t3_2ryflh,cnknbq4,"""You could read and recall every book that has been written and still not be considered intelligent."" That's theoretically true, but if someone actually managed to read and recall every book ever written, it would be goddamn near impossible to not learn an immense amount from them. If the person in question read the books passively without remembering them, it'd be easy to say that they didn't properly learn and gain anything from them, but I find it absolutely impossible for someone to absorb and retain that much information without gaining a significant amount of intelligence."

t3_2rxwvl,cnli4sx,"It's not that Qui-Gon doesn't care about slavery: Tatooine is outside meaningful Republic control. Like Padme says, the Republic wouldn't tolerate it, but like Shmi says, the Republic basically doesn't exist out there. Qui-Gon is one Jedi, and he's on a mission where he's deliberately trying not to attract attention."
t3_2rtxcw,cnj9t8c,"Words aren't money, and the vagueness of ""under God"" is I think what keeps it from unfairly supporting anything. Atheists have tried to get the phrase removed but the Supreme Court buckled under pressure from Republican Congress.

t3_2rtxcw,cnjav1o,"I think ""choose your battles"" is a more important lesson than ""refuse to go along with saying a word or phrase (or at least mumble along) that makes you slightly uncomfortable.""

t3_2rq5g3,cnih5d9,"Who is to say the extremely improbable (approaching zero) probability this occurs for every being in heaven is not possibly going to be the case? It'd be pretty ridiculous, but yet still actually possible. Infinity and probability are strange things, and perhaps this insanely unlikely outcome occurs for every person who makes it into heaven; it could theoretically happen, and there would be no issue with ""free will"" being violated here."
t3_2rq5g3,cnih5d9,"Saying that you must also be free to pick an sufficiently bad option if you have a choice is probably wrong; you can totally have a choice, even a free choice, between various forms of exercise without including ""stabbing someone to death"" as a possible exercise choice (let's say, in a reality where that's physically impossible). One example would be that you have an infinite number of choices, but none of them involve sin. Even if you have a finite number of choices, and you can freely choose, and none of them involves sin, is this not still ""free will""?"
