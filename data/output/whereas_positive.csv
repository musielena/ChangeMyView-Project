t3_2d9xj4,cjnit4x,"I can guess to maybe within 30 seconds or so when 5 minutes pass (and again, not some bullshit ""consensual reality"" thing - we can count the vibrations of a quartz crystal under electric current and know objectively what 5 minutes is), whereas under mushrooms, I seriously watched the time go from 5:00 to 5:30 minute by minute, each minute lasting what felt like hours and hours (though the entire half-hour seemed to have gone by in a few minutes after the 30 minutes were up)."

t3_1mdwb3,cc8dkwo,"The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a >50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty."
