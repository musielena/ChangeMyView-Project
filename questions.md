# Questions

- How should I calculate pmi for the selected phrases (or do I do so at all). I'm not sure nltk has an arbitrary n-gram
pmi generation algorithm. Would I need to write one myself?

- Should I lemmatize before looking for phrases? Wouldn't the phrases for which the program need to be lemmatized
beforehand?
